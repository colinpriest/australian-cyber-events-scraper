Perth Mint has been targeted by hackers for the second time in two years, this time resulting in a data breach that has compromised the details of more than 1000 visitors.
The stolen information included contact details of 1480 people who filled out feedback surveys at the West Australian government-owned mint's depository and included visitor names, email addresses, home addresses and telephone numbers.
The mint confirmed on Friday the survey information was stored by Perth market insights company Metrix Consulting and the contact details had been stolen when an employee of the company fell victim to a phishing scam.

""The breach occurred when a Metrix Consulting staff member was the subject of a phishing email scam which infiltrated the company’s IT system,"" Perth Mint acting chief executive Jane King said.
""We have acted quickly to notify our visitors whose information has been accessed and to apologise for any distress caused. We have also offered them identification support services.""
Metrix Consulting managing director Marquis Pohla said the firm would be building on ""already strong"" IT practices after becoming aware of the breach.
""Like the many companies that all too often now find themselves targeted by unscrupulous hackers, we have been angered by this data breach – the first we have ever experienced in ten years of operation,"" he said.
""An independent forensic investigation is now underway and we are working with the Perth Mint and various regulatory authorities to address any potential risks.
""At this stage, we have not identified any other client customer data as being impacted.

""We unreservedly apologise to the Perth Mint and its valued customers for any distress caused by this unfortunate incident.""
Both the mint and Metrix Consulting are investigating the incident and details of the breach were also passed on to WA Police.
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Australian Cyber Security Centre were also notified of the breach, and Ms King said Metrix and the mint would continue to work with relevant agencies to find the source of the phishing scam.
Ms King said anyone who believed they may be affected by the breach should contact the Perth Mint on 1800 098 817 or 9421 7218.
It is the second time Perth Mint has been involved in a serious data breach in two years,
after online gold trading customers who used the mint's online system in September 2018 had personal information, including addresses, bank account numbers, passport and drivers licence details, illegally accessed in a separate data breach.
The mint initially claimed the breach had only affected 13 customers, but it was later revealed up to 3200 people had likely been affected.
The mint also came under fire when it only notified customers three days after they became aware of the breach, but a spokesman later defended the decision to the
Australian Financial Review
and said it had only wanted to notify affected customers as soon as they had ""sufficient information about the extent of the breach"".
The mint made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange as the first exchange-traded fund with sovereign-backed gold in 2018.

A data leak from an international pornography website has exposed copies of passports, credit cards, birth certificates and other sensitive personal details of thousands of actors in the adult entertainment industry, according to cyber researchers.
9News understands more than 4000 people - including Australians - were affected.
The discovery was made by cyber security research team vpnMentor, which notified the company involved, Pussycash.com.
9News understands more than 4000 people - including Australians - were affected.

The network promotes a number of adult websites, including webcam chatroom ImLive, which has 66 million registered users.
It lists Pornhub and BeNaughty among its major partners.
In
a report provided to 9News
, lead researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar claim they found at least 875,000 files on a US-based Amazon server, belonging to the network.
The files included videos, marketing materials, photographs, clips and screenshots of video chats and zip files.
There were also ""model biographies"" which included intimate details such as sexual preferences.
A copy of a US military identification card was also found.
""Within nearly every zip file our researchers discovered was everything necessary for a criminal to easily assume the identity of another,"" the report claims.
While there's no suggestion the data was accessed by cyber-criminals, the researchers say it could prove devastating if it fell into the wrong hands.
""Other risks to be considered are people impersonating these (actors) to scam others, blackmail and extortion, stalking, job loss and professional embarrassment,"" vpnMentor researcher Lisa Taylor said.
The incident has prompted a broader cyber safety warning to all internet users.
""Whether you work in the porn industry or not, we recommend to never send out unredacted scans or pictures of your passports, credit cards and any document with personal information,"" Ms Taylor said.
""This is what makes this breach so critical and dangerous for the people in it.""

WA's P&N Bank hit by data breach
By
Justin Hendry
Jan 16 2020 11:15AM
""Non-sensitive"" data from CRM accessed.
Western Australia’s largest member owned bank, P&N Bank, has notified its customers of a data breach that exposed personal information from its customer relationship management system.
In an email to its approximately 96,000 members on Wednesday, P&N CEO Andrew Hadley said “non-sensitive” data had been accessed as a result of a cyber-attack last month.
Information contained in the CRM includes customer names and ages, residential addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, customer numbers, account numbers and account balances.
Formerly the Police & Nurses Credit Society, a significant proportion of P&N Bank members are, logically, police and nurses.
Hadley stressed that no customer passwords or credit card details had been compromised, as its core banking system was “completely isolated and separated from the impacted system”.
Other information such as driver’s licence numbers, passport numbers, social security numbers, tax file numbers, birthdays or health data was also not contained in the CRM.
P&N Bank is now working closely with the Western Australian Police Force (WAPOL) and relevant federal authorities to investigate the incident, which occurred during a server upgrade.
“The criminal activity took place around 12 December 2019, via an attack during a server upgrade, on a third party company that P&N Bank engages to provide hosting services,” Hadley said.
“Upon becoming aware of the attack, we immediately shut down the source of the vulnerability and have since been working closely with WAPOL, other federal authorities, our third-party IT provider involved, regulators and independent expert advisers to investigate and protect customers from any further risk.”

“Upon becoming aware of the attack, we immediately shut down the source of the vulnerability and have since been working closely with WAPOL, other federal authorities, our third-party IT provider involved, regulators and independent expert advisers to investigate and protect customers from any further risk.”
iTnews has contacted P&N Bank for further comment.

The group behind the attack, known as REvil, claim to have gained access to Travelex's network six months ago.
REvil says it has a 5GB stash of downloaded information from the company, including customer dates of birth, credit card information and national insurance numbers.
""In the case of payment, we will delete and will not use that (data)base and restore them the entire network,"" the group said in a statement.
""The deadline for doubling the payment is two days. Then another seven days and the sale of the entire base.""

Travelex may be set to face further punishment after the ICO revealed it had not received a data breach notice from the company. Under GDPR legislation, organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours - unless the breach is deemed not to pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms.
Failure to comply could cost Travelex millions in fines, with the ICO able to issue a fine of four percent of an offender's global turnover.
""If an organisation decides that a breach doesn't need to be reported, they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn't reported if necessary,"" the ICO added.
Travelex says it is working with the Metropolitan Police alongside its own teams of IT specialists and external cyber-security experts to investigate the attack.
""On Thursday, 2 January, the Met's Cyber Crime Team were contacted with regards to a reported ransomware attack involving a foreign currency exchange,"" the Met said in a statement. ""Inquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.""

Hellenic Republic Kew becomes Sardinian restaurant Vita

Malloreddus pasta with pork, fennel and ricotta.
The Made Establishment has recruited its next hospitality heavy hitter. Longtime owner of Becco, Simon Hartley has come on board to captain the transformation of Hellenic Kew into Vita, a casual Sardinian restaurant reflecting head chef Nathaniel Destefano's roots.
Hartley will continue to operate Becco while applying his service and kitchen style, honed over 24 years at the CBD institution, to the Kew restaurant.
Vita had a quiet test-run in December prior to Hartley's appointment, so the final offering is still unfolding.
Bomboloni with Nutella.
The wine list currently represents most of Italy, from Sicily to Piedmont, but Hartley says that will only deepen.
The Sardinian menu will mix the traditional (malloreddus, or Sardinian gnocchi, with fennel, pork and ricotta), the personal (Destefano's mum's lasagne with pulled, instead of minced, meat), and all-round bangers like a cheese-heavy antipasti selection, porchetta from the wood-fired oven, zucchini cacio e pepe and bombolini.
As with Hellenic Republic Brunswick East (now Crofter under Matt Wilkinson) and Hellenic Hotel (now Hotel Argentina), the makeover has been subtle.
Head chefNathanielDestefano (left) and Simon Hartley outside Vita in Kew.
""Just whiter and brighter"", says Hartley, ""with a couple of new pizza ovens.""
Two private dining rooms upstairs can also be joined for large functions.
In Becco news, Hartley is still looking at new CBD sites for when the city stalwart moves in July 2021 at the end of its Crossley Street lease.
Vita is now open daily noon-4pm and 4.30-9.30pm at 26 Cotham Road, Kew, 03 9207 7477

US Warns Britain Against China's Huawei 5G Network
Voice of America
27 Jan 2020, 04:35 GMT+10
U.S. President Donald Trump has warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""serious consequences"" if he allows the Chinese telecom giant Huawei a role in building Britain's 5G phone network, according to officials on both sides of the Atlantic.
The warning follows months of lobbying of Downing Street by top U.S. officials who aim to persuade the British government to shut out the Chinese company on security grounds.
Trump told Johnson Friday that giving Huawei, which has ties to Chinese intelligence agencies, the go-ahead will cause a major rift in transatlantic relations and jeopardize intelligence-sharing between Washington and London, according to U.S. officials. They say the decision, expected Tuesday, will also likely impact the prospects for a post-Brexit transatlantic trade deal eagerly sought by Britain to compensate for likely diminished trade with the European Union.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Saturday dubbed the Huawei deal a threat to ""critical"" infrastructure. But he indicated that if Downing Street falls into line, the U.S. will ""dedicate a lot of resources"" to getting a trade deal negotiated and signed by the end of the year.
The Huawei decision is also being watched closely on Capitol Hill.
In an unprecedented move, three Republican senators -- Tom Cotton, John Cornyn and Marco Rubio -- sent a letter to Britain's National Security Council urging Huawei to be excluded from 5G development. ""The company's actions show a clear record of predatory and problematic behavior,"" the senators said, adding it would ""in the best interest of the United Kingdom, the US-UK special relationship, and the health and wellbeing of a well-functioning market for 5G technologies to exclude Huawei.""
US sees Trojan horse
For a year, the Trump administration has been urging Britain to ban the Chinese company from participating in the development of Britain's fifth-generation wireless network. U.S. officials say there's a significant risk that the Chinese telecoms giant will act as a Trojan horse for Beijing's espionage agencies, planting 'backdoors' into any equipment supplied to Britain, enabling data to be swept up and intelligence gathered. The U.S. imposed its own trade restrictions on Huawei last year.
Huawei vehemently denies that it could be used by Beijing for intelligence purposes, saying that U.S. allegations are ""baseless speculation."" The Chinese government says Huawei is a private company and poses no security risk to the West.
But Beijing has also made ill-disguised threats, suggesting a decision to ban Huawei could result in Britain being punished when it comes to Chinese trade and investment. Similar warnings have been issued to other Western countries, all of which have been urged by U.S. officials to shun Huawei on security grounds.
U.S. lobbying has been especially fierce among members of the 'Five Eyes' intelligence-sharing pact -- the U.S.-led Anglophone intelligence arrangement linking Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain. Australia and New Zealand, although as yet not Canada, have banned Huawei from any role in developing their 5G networks. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to make a last effort to dissuade Johnson during a visit to London this week.
In Germany, the Huawei issue has sparked a major division between Chancellor Angel Merkel, who fears Chinese retaliation if Huawei is excluded, and her coalition partners, the Social Democrats, who are opposed to offering Huawei any 5G role. Merkel's ministries are also deeply split, with the trade and finance ministers backing Huawei's involvement and foreign and intelligence officials highly skeptical that the risks are worth it.
Both the White House and Downing Street have sought to play down talk of a transatlantic rift. In a bland statement Friday, the White House said Trump and Johnson ""discussed important regional and bilateral issues, including working together to ensure the security of our telecommunications networks.""
'Next Chinese virus'
A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister spoke to president Trump. They discussed a range of issues, including cooperation to ensure the security of our telecommunications networks.""
But behind the scenes, the lobbying has been furious and the issue risks splitting the British cabinet, with several ministers determined to block Huawei, fearing the damage that could be done to Britain's so-called special relationship with the U.S.
The crescendo of the U.S. anti-Huawei campaign has been mirrored in London as it emerged last week that Johnson appeared set to give Huawei the green light, discounting U.S. alarm and prompting growing unease among his own Conservative lawmakers. Some have likened the political damage Huawei is causing to the coronavirus epidemic threatening to spread to the West, saying it is the ""next Chinese virus.""
If Johnson does give the go-ahead, it would confirm a 'provisional' decision made by his predecessor in Downing Street, Theresa May. Last year, she said Huawei should be allowed to build some so-called 'non-core' parts of Britain's future 5G data network.
U.S. intelligence officials and their counterparts at Britain's GCHQ, the eavesdropping spy agency and the country's largest intelligence service, say restricting Huawei to the non-core 'edges' of the new network would make little difference to the security risk.
Johnson has come under pressure from British telecom providers and mobile phone companies, which have already been installing Huawei technology to start setting up the new network. They have warned that Huawei offers more advanced, better integrated and cheaper equipment than its commercial rivals, and banning the company would delay the rollout of 5G, costing the British economy billions of pounds.

US Warns Britain Against China's Huawei 5G Network
Voice of America
27 Jan 2020, 04:35 GMT+10
U.S. President Donald Trump has warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""serious consequences"" if he allows the Chinese telecom giant Huawei a role in building Britain's 5G phone network, according to officials on both sides of the Atlantic.
The warning follows months of lobbying of Downing Street by top U.S. officials who aim to persuade the British government to shut out the Chinese company on security grounds.
Trump told Johnson Friday that giving Huawei, which has ties to Chinese intelligence agencies, the go-ahead will cause a major rift in transatlantic relations and jeopardize intelligence-sharing between Washington and London, according to U.S. officials. They say the decision, expected Tuesday, will also likely impact the prospects for a post-Brexit transatlantic trade deal eagerly sought by Britain to compensate for likely diminished trade with the European Union.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Saturday dubbed the Huawei deal a threat to ""critical"" infrastructure. But he indicated that if Downing Street falls into line, the U.S. will ""dedicate a lot of resources"" to getting a trade deal negotiated and signed by the end of the year.
The Huawei decision is also being watched closely on Capitol Hill.
In an unprecedented move, three Republican senators -- Tom Cotton, John Cornyn and Marco Rubio -- sent a letter to Britain's National Security Council urging Huawei to be excluded from 5G development. ""The company's actions show a clear record of predatory and problematic behavior,"" the senators said, adding it would ""in the best interest of the United Kingdom, the US-UK special relationship, and the health and wellbeing of a well-functioning market for 5G technologies to exclude Huawei.""
US sees Trojan horse
For a year, the Trump administration has been urging Britain to ban the Chinese company from participating in the development of Britain's fifth-generation wireless network. U.S. officials say there's a significant risk that the Chinese telecoms giant will act as a Trojan horse for Beijing's espionage agencies, planting 'backdoors' into any equipment supplied to Britain, enabling data to be swept up and intelligence gathered. The U.S. imposed its own trade restrictions on Huawei last year.
Huawei vehemently denies that it could be used by Beijing for intelligence purposes, saying that U.S. allegations are ""baseless speculation."" The Chinese government says Huawei is a private company and poses no security risk to the West.
But Beijing has also made ill-disguised threats, suggesting a decision to ban Huawei could result in Britain being punished when it comes to Chinese trade and investment. Similar warnings have been issued to other Western countries, all of which have been urged by U.S. officials to shun Huawei on security grounds.
U.S. lobbying has been especially fierce among members of the 'Five Eyes' intelligence-sharing pact -- the U.S.-led Anglophone intelligence arrangement linking Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain. Australia and New Zealand, although as yet not Canada, have banned Huawei from any role in developing their 5G networks. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to make a last effort to dissuade Johnson during a visit to London this week.
In Germany, the Huawei issue has sparked a major division between Chancellor Angel Merkel, who fears Chinese retaliation if Huawei is excluded, and her coalition partners, the Social Democrats, who are opposed to offering Huawei any 5G role. Merkel's ministries are also deeply split, with the trade and finance ministers backing Huawei's involvement and foreign and intelligence officials highly skeptical that the risks are worth it.
Both the White House and Downing Street have sought to play down talk of a transatlantic rift. In a bland statement Friday, the White House said Trump and Johnson ""discussed important regional and bilateral issues, including working together to ensure the security of our telecommunications networks.""
'Next Chinese virus'
A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister spoke to president Trump. They discussed a range of issues, including cooperation to ensure the security of our telecommunications networks.""
But behind the scenes, the lobbying has been furious and the issue risks splitting the British cabinet, with several ministers determined to block Huawei, fearing the damage that could be done to Britain's so-called special relationship with the U.S.
The crescendo of the U.S. anti-Huawei campaign has been mirrored in London as it emerged last week that Johnson appeared set to give Huawei the green light, discounting U.S. alarm and prompting growing unease among his own Conservative lawmakers. Some have likened the political damage Huawei is causing to the coronavirus epidemic threatening to spread to the West, saying it is the ""next Chinese virus.""
If Johnson does give the go-ahead, it would confirm a 'provisional' decision made by his predecessor in Downing Street, Theresa May. Last year, she said Huawei should be allowed to build some so-called 'non-core' parts of Britain's future 5G data network.
U.S. intelligence officials and their counterparts at Britain's GCHQ, the eavesdropping spy agency and the country's largest intelligence service, say restricting Huawei to the non-core 'edges' of the new network would make little difference to the security risk.
Johnson has come under pressure from British telecom providers and mobile phone companies, which have already been installing Huawei technology to start setting up the new network. They have warned that Huawei offers more advanced, better integrated and cheaper equipment than its commercial rivals, and banning the company would delay the rollout of 5G, costing the British economy billions of pounds.

Rubbery figures on emissions hide poor performance

Normal text sizeLarger text sizeVery large text size
It is time the government was honest on emissions performance (“PM accused of cooking the books on emissions”, January 14). The most consistent emissions reductions occurred under the “carbon tax”. The misleading use by the government of per ''capita emissions'' (second worst in the world but marginally reducing), ''emissions intensities'' and comparing our emissions against a 2012 forecast does not give the true picture of the current underperformance.
As a start, the government must quote emissions as defined by the Paris protocol. The best figures would be all emissions that Australia is responsible for including our bushfire emissions and emissions associated with our fossil fuel exports. - Keith Woodward, Avalon Beach
Carbon emissions down all of 1.5 per cent, or was that 3 million tonnes compared to 10 years ago or was it 5 per cent this year relative to 2000? It’s like working out how much water it takes to drown in. - Steve Dillon, Thirroul
I note the PM is still using phrases like "" than under the previous government"" in the midst of a disaster of biblical proportions. The PM is dithering and political point scoring while pandering to the back benches. The country doesn't need politicking, it needs decisive action and informed policy development. Not much chance of that from this lot, they don't understand the science nor the urgency. - John Grinter, Katoomba
The argument floated about Australia’s emissions being so small in relation to global emissions that we shouldn’t be obligated to do much is like the picnic analogy. I go to the park with my children for a picnic. At the end I look down and see the mess we’ve made. I then look at the rest of the park and it too is a mess. I then reason, why should I pick up my rubbish when compared to the rest, it’s so small and makes little impact. So I say to the children, leave it all there. No wonder they strike and call us out. And so should they. - Donald Sleer, Manly
It could be debatable whether a royal commission is necessary to achieve a “resilient legal framework” for future bushfires, however we do not want the flurry of activity to distract – or excuse – the PM and opposition leader from the most important challenge; strong, meaningful action on climate change (Letters, January 14).
Nobody seriously expects an immediate closure of Australia’s coal mines and coal-fired power stations, however real leaders should, by now, be articulating clear “transition plans” out of fossil fuels and into the renewables and other industries. Unfortunately, it seems both leaders have placed “transition” in the too-hard basket. - Rob Firth, Cremorne Point
Greg Combet has a ''novel'' suggestion (''Australia needs to punch above its weight on carbon emissions'', January 14). All parties get together, respect the science and work out a path forward. PR man Morrison seems only to able to spruik the coal industry’s fossil fiction. - Rosalind Ward, Balmain
I’m wondering if Zali Steggall has a friend in the Shire who might be considering putting her hand up for a run at Cook in the next election? I think she might be in with a chance. - Robin Love, Rozelle
Tackle feral animals as we nurture natives
In the 1980s, John Williamson wrote “Goodbye Bunyip Bluegum, goodbye Blinky Bill, and beautiful little Nutsie. I can’t believe it. Our koalas are all dying, can it really be? A national disaster, a world catastrophe.” And here we are, more than 30 years later and facing this reality. It would seem we are a country that only learns things the hard way (''Koalas are barely hanging on'', January 14).
Your correspondent makes an excellent point about not wasting this bushfire disaster. Let’s double or triple the funding and staff in our national parks country-wide and use some recovery efforts for the eradication of feral animals as well as invasive exotic flora and protect the environment for our struggling native wildlife and plants. - Christine Hackwood, North Lakes
It is now on the record. Sussan Ley, the federal Environment Minister, said “everything that can be done will be done” to save koalas from extinction. The minister should urgently use her federal powers to stop logging in any koala forests on the NSW north and south coasts that remain unburnt.
And she must stem the rampant urban sprawl that is threatening the koalas around Campbelltown, Appin and Wilton. Ironically, these “city” koalas have become even more precious as our more distant forests have become wildlife crematoriums. - Sharyn Cullis, Oatley
I have just finished the saddest book, Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe. It has moved me to think that our increasingly ferocious and destructive bushfires are karma for the ignorant, cruel, arrogant and greedy takeover of Australia from the original inhabitants. This attitude continues and we are ruining our ancient, fragile, beautiful country by lack of understanding how to live with it rather than imprint our own ideas on how to utilise it. We exploit rather than nurture. - Christine Perrott, Armidale
While unfortunately some died from the bushfires, the “pink mist” from the sky is likely to be the new asbestos of the future (''Retardant threat to water supplies'', January 14). - Tim Schroder, Gordon
Overseas friends texted that they are praying we get rain soon. We replied that our government has been doing only that for several years and they have proven that it’s not a successful strategy. We added that we are living in hope of a Plan B, involving consultation with a number of experts in several fields, including firefighters and climate change scientists, with a long term view towards the future of our children and grandchildren. We also asked them to keep praying, just in case there’s no Plan B. - Peta Patton, Newport
Let's follow the lead on zero road toll
Pleasing to see Transport Minister Andrew Constance was impressed by Norwegian road safety advertisements (“Zero road deaths : Oslo shows it’s possible”, January 14).
I hope he is equally impressed by the approach of Oslo’s Mayor: “It’s all about humans taking back the streets from cars.” - Geoffrey Williamson, Woollahra
If there were lessons on road safety to be drawn from Oslo, it wouldn't be the first time that Norwegian city had been a guiding light on health and safety. In the 1940s, I was among the many thousands of Aussie schoolchildren who were fed the Oslo Lunch. This nutritious combination of bread, cheese, tomato and fruit put roses on cheeks grown pale from wartime food rationing. - Garth Clarke, North Sydney
Norway has zero-alcohol tolerance for all drivers, not just P-plate drivers. This undoubtedly has a major positive impact on road safety. - Susanne Collins, Warners Bay
The primary reason Oslo and many western European cities have reduced their deaths and serious injury toll is that the speed limit in areas of high pedestrian activity is 30 km/h. The London CBD will be 20 mph (32 km/h) by the end of this year. In Sydney, for example, areas around the ABC and UTS, where there is huge pedestrian activity, the speed limit is 50 km/h. The sooner Australian cities embrace the 30km system, the sooner we will reach the enviable Oslo example. - Harold Scruby, CEO Pedestrian Council of Australia Limited
Harry puts family first
Why all the fuss about Harry and Meghan wanting to leave the royal firm and lead a more private life (''Harry and Meghan score a win but this drama has a long way yet to run'', smh.com.au, January 14)? The Queen and her advisers must surely have sensed something in the wind when the Sussexes named their child Archie Harrison. -Graham Russell, Clovelly
When all is said and done, Harry is still family. Blood is thicker than water. Many younger siblings of the aristocracy have faced the same issues. So long as there is family love they will weather this. Unfortunately, their status means a family issue is played out in public. They don’t have the luxury of keeping it private. - Augusta Monro, Dundas
Usually, the Queen is dressed in bright colours but she was papped this week on her way to church wearing a dowdy brown coat and hat. She must be really upset by the most recent disastrous rift in her family. - Joan Dalgleish, Ballina
2019 exposed the Prince Andrew debacle. 2020 reveals Prince Harry, quite reasonably, taking charge of his family's more private future. Two more examples of why Australians deserve the right to elect their head of state rather than relying on birth-right of a foreign sovereign. - Russell Murphy, Bayview
While we're at it, can we have a royal commission into the royals? - Kent Mayo, Uralla
Pipe down ex-Pope
Though pledging obedience to the Pope, Benedict can't help interfering in the current issue of priest celibacy within the Catholic Church. What is it with past leaders unable to ""remain hidden from the outside world"" – we have certainly had our share (''Two Popes face off'', January 14).
I feel sorry for Pope Francis. A difficult issue made much more difficult, coming again from someone who promised loyalty and non-interference. - Elizabeth Kroon, Randwick
Good Lord. Is the ""hidden Pope"" suggesting that once we marry life's mysteries will elude us? - David Reid, Artarmon
Rabbitt in the spotlight
Latrell Mitchell is evidently an intelligent young man (""He's one happy bunny"", January 14). Having signed with Souths on Monday he is quoted as saying, ""I knew if I jumped straight into that Tigers deal I probably would have regretted it"". As an old Lidcombe Oval regular, it's a sentence I wish the Western Suburbs Magpies had been in a position to deliver back during the earliest years of the new millennium. - Andrew Stark, East Gosford
Strong stance required
There is an outrageous proposition at the heart of the Julian Assange extradition trial (“WikiLeaks' Julian Assange in UK court fighting extradition to US”, January 14). The US is arguing that an Australian can be guilty of breaking US law even when he is not in the US, and when the actions for which he is being prosecuted were entirely legal in the country he was in at the time. The Australian government should take a strong stand on this issue, or are we all subject to the excesses of US law, everywhere in the world? - George Rosier, Carlingford
Stars in smokey eyes
Last night I wandered outside and what a glorious surprise! For the first time in what seems like months some of my old friends were back (""Australia's bushfire smoke will do a full lap of the earth: NASA"", smh.com.au, January 14). In a band of clear sky there was the Orion constellation, next to the Dog Star group, (as usual, on his back wanting his tummy scratched) which includes our brightest star Sirius. Further south was our second brightest, Canopus, all in a line! With some steady rain on the way let’s hope we see more of them, along with some positive action by our governments to prevent this horrible summer from reoccurring. - Ian Bryant, Barden Ridge
Women coping with crisis
Most of us see two women politicians, Gladys Berejiklian and Jacinda Ardern, dealing with recent crises in their respective countries, as the “ultimate humanists” (""Recovery the priority over reviews: minister"", January 14). Are women in powerful positions superior performers in crisis situations? As the world is expected to experience further catastrophic events, would it be wise to elevate more women to leadership positions? - Jill Phillips, Ettalong Beach
Quiet Australian speaks
Yes, Sue Jay, we don’t march, we don’t stand outside public buildings chanting, we don’t impede the daily grind of your average citizen (Letters, January 13). We exercise our right when and where it counts. That is why we have been labelled “The Quiet Australians”. - Beverley Izard, Sancrox
Sky-high prices not standard
In Lisbon, regardless of how many metro lines a passenger uses to get to the airport, the journey costs $2. Are the metro administrators in Lisbon silly, or are we taken for a ride in Sydney (""State collects $110m a year from fees on airport train passengers"")? - Mustafa Erem, Terrigal
A welcome word
Has the delightful word “bloviating” ever been deployed in the Herald before? If not, it’s one Americanism we should definitely welcome (''Iranian threats ring hollow'', January 14).
Bloviate means “to talk at length, especially in an inflated or empty way”. It would be so useful when describing many of the speeches and interviews of our politicians, starting with our Prime Minister. - Ian Black, Redfern
Watch your backs
Staring at a seagull may ward off an attack on one’s food but what to do when they attack from behind (''When the chips are down, stare at a seagull to save your snack'', January 14)? I spend considerable time at both Balmoral and Cronulla beaches indulging in fish and chips and have noticed that while our southern birds mount an attack from the front, the northern beaches birds swoop from the back. Obviously our northern Aves have learnt from history which tells us that all successful battles, such as the Battle of Cannae led by Hannibal, have been won with attacks from the rear. - Elizabeth Maher, Bangor
Sad day for smiles
Who is going to say ""Have a good day"" with a smile? Certainly not an automated checkout (""Checkout-free push for Coles' supermarkets"", January 13). - Denis Suttling, Newport Beach

Britain's Johnson Poised to Give Huawei Role in 5G Development
Voice of America
21 Jan 2020, 02:35 GMT+10
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson appears set to give the go-ahead for Chinese telecom giant Huawei to play a role in the development of Britain's 5G wireless network - a move that risks jeopardizing intelligence-sharing between Britain and America, according U.S. officials.
Despite last-ditch lobbying by the U.S. to block Huawei, British officials say it is a ""foregone conclusion"" Johnson will allow Huawei participation.
That would confirm a ""provisional"" decision made by his predecessor, Theresa May. Last year, she said Huawei should be allowed to build some so-called ""non-core"" parts of Britain's future 5G data network, discounting U.S. alarm.
Johnson's final decision could come as early as this week, officials say.
For a year, the Trump administration has urged Britain to ban Huawei from participating in the development of Britain's fifth-generation wireless network. U.S. officials say there's a significant risk that the company, which has close ties to Chinese intelligence services, will act as a Trojan horse for Beijing's espionage agencies, allowing them to sweep up data and gather intelligence.
Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged all Western allies to shun Huawei on security grounds. They have specifically warned Downing Street that Britain's participation in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing arrangement - the U.S.-led Anglophone intelligence pact linking Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain - would be imperiled.
Australia and New Zealand have banned Huawei from developing their 5G networks. As yet, Canada has not.
Senior U.S. security officials flew to London last week and warned Johnson and his ministers that allowing Huawei to supply even some non-core equipment of the future 5G network would be ""nothing short of madness.""
Cost factor
But Johnson has faced strong counter lobbying from China - and also from British telecom providers and mobile phone companies. They have already been installing Huawei technology to start setting up the new network in more than 70 cities in Britain. They warn that delaying the rollout of 5G would cost the British economy billions of pounds. Ripping out masts and other equipment already in place would cost British providers hundreds of millions of pounds and could delay by up to five years the 5G network.
Last week, Johnson expressed frustration with the U.S. over the issue, saying in a BBC radio interview that he didn't want ""to prejudice our national security or our ability to co-operate with Five Eyes intelligence partners,"" but that he wanted Britain to have ""access to the best possible technology. We want to put in gigabit broadband for everybody.""
Johnson added, ""If people oppose one brand or another, then they have to tell us what's the alternative.""
U.S. officials reportedly told Johnson that Britain shouldn't prioritize costs over security.
Johnson has some U.S. supporters.
""It is a difficult decision for a number of countries, the U.K. being one of them,"" said Robert Manning, an analyst at the Atlantic Council.
Huawei alternatives
Manning sympathizes with Johnson's complaint that the U.S. isn't offering any alternatives to Huawei.
""On one level, this is all a fallout from America First policy. We should have sat down with our allies a long time ago to sort out what you have to worry about and what you might have some leeway on. There is a certain demonization going on, "" he told VOA.
British technology experts say it is easier for the U.S. to avoid using Huawei equipment, as it is building a less sophisticated 5G network and doesn't require the advanced antenna-sharing technology Huawei has developed. They say Huawei will provide not just faster mobile data connection but easier connectivity between internet-based devices, from laptops and smart refrigerators to self-driving cars.
U.S. giants Cisco and Qualcomm are the go-to 5G equipment suppliers in America. But like Europe's Ericsson and Nokia, they can't currently provide the same advanced equipment as Huawei or at the same low price.
Security risks
British intelligence agencies are split on whether Huawei poses a security risk.
Andrew Parker, head of MI5, believes U.S. alarm is overblown. He has said publicly that the security risks can be managed if Huawei has access to the less sensitive parts of the new network, and is monitored closely and its equipment screened.
He has also discounted U.S. threats to review intelligence-sharing, saying there is ""no reason to think"" Washington would follow through with its threat, as the U.S.-U.K. partnership is ""very close and very trusted.""
But U.S. officials have told VOA that Parker is wrong to think that U.S. intelligence agencies would overlook the spying fears. They also warn that a possible Johnson fudge, whereby Huawei's equipment would be allowed in less sensitive parts of the network, wouldn't assuage their concerns.
Top officials at Britain's GCHQ, the eavesdropping spy agency and the country's largest intelligence, aren't as sanguine as Parker, and remain worried about the risks of handing Huawei unprecedented access to British citizens' sensitive data.
They agree with U.S. intelligence assessments that restricting Huawei to the ""edges"" of the new network would make little difference to the security risk. They told Britain's Sunday Times that giving Huawei such access would be akin to ""letting a fox loose in a chicken coop.""
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who when in office ruled out using Huawei for 5G development, said the nature of 5G technology made it impossible to separate the core from non-core elements of the future network. He said Huawei could be forced by Chinese law to hand over information to Beijing's espionage agencies.
""Do you want to give China the capability to materially interfere with what will become one of the most fundamental technological platforms in the modern economy?"" he said in a radio interview last week.
The Chinese government says Huawei is a private company and poses no security risk to the West. Huawei has dismissed U.S. allegations that it could undermine Britain's national security as ""baseless speculation.""
Beijing has also made thinly veiled threats, suggesting a decision to ban Huawei could result in Britain being punished when it comes to trade and investment.
Britain hopes to pull off post-Brexit trade deals with both Washington and Beijing to help compensate for reduced trade with Europe.

Australia fires 'long way from over' but rain brings relief
PUBLISHED : 11 JAN 2020 AT 07:45
WRITER: AFP

The milderconditions are expected to last around a week, giving firefighters time to try to get the fires under control.
MERIMBULA, Australia: Massive bushfires in southeastern Australia have a ""long way to go"", authorities have warned, even as colder conditions brought some relief to exhausted firefighters and communities on Saturday.
After a blustery night that saw a series of massive infernos in New South Wales and Victoria states merge into a mega-blaze four times the size of Greater London, temperatures dropped and rain fell on fire-scarred regions.
""Whilst it was a very long and -- in parts of New South Wales -- difficult night, we're relieved this morning that no lives have been lost and no substantial property damage,"" New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Saturday.
The milder conditions are expected to last around a week, giving firefighters time to try to get the fires under control.
New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the conditions as the ""best seven days we have had without a rise of very dangerous fire ratings"".
In a matter of months, the catastrophic bushfires have killed at least 26 people, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched some 100,000 square kilometres -- an area larger than South Korea or Portugal.
University researchers estimate that more than one billion mammals, birds and reptiles have been killed in the blazes.
Despite the cool change, authorities warned that the bushfire season is not yet over, with hundreds of fires across several states still raging.
In Victoria state, Premier Daniel Andrews called on communities to remain vigilant and warned that the months-long crisis was ""a long way from over"".
The head of a firefighting ""strike team"" in the New South Wales village of Towamba, Nathan Barnden, told AFP the rainfall was ""fantastic"" but ""not enough at this stage to put these fires out"".
""We're going to need hundreds of millimetres over a period of time to... make firefighting easier for us,"" he said.
On Friday, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across the nation's cities, calling on Australia's conservative government to take stronger action on climate change.
Scientists say climate change has contributed to the lengthening of the fire seasons and fuelled more frequent and intense blazes.
The Australian Academy of Science, an independent organisation representing the country's leading scientists, said Canberra ""must take stronger action"" as part of its global commitments to limit global warming.
""The scientific evidence base shows that as the world warms due to human-induced climate change, we experience an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events,"" the academy's president John Shine said in a statement.
""As a nation, we must deal with extreme weather events more effectively than we currently do.""
Australia experienced its driest and hottest year on record in 2019, with its highest average maximum temperature of 41.9 degrees Celsius recorded in mid-December.
Despite growing domestic and international criticism, Prime Minister Scott Morrison -- who has long touted the importance of commodity exports such as coal for Australia's economy -- has repeatedly defended his government's climate policies.
The unprecedented crisis has also sparked an outpouring of fundraising from celebrities, sportspeople and locals in support of volunteer firefighters at the frontlines and devastated communities.
The Sydney Opera House will project images shot during the fires onto the building's sails Saturday, ahead of a comedy gala fundraiser.

France calls for ‘gesture’ from Iran over detained academics

France said on Friday that the imprisonment of two prominent French academics by Iran was unacceptable and that their release would represent a “significant gesture,” as tensions mount between Tehran and the West.
The plea for the release of Fariba Adelkhah and Roland Marchal -- imprisoned since June last year -- comes as Iran is embroiled in an international crisis over its missile attacks on US troops in Iraq and a passenger plane crash near Tehran.
“These arrests and the fact that they are in prison today is totally unacceptable,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told RTL radio.
“It would be a significant gesture if Iran freed them as soon as possible.”
France has repeatedly called for de-escalation in the latest intensification of the Iran-US standoff, sparked by the killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in an American drone strike which prompted Iran to attack bases in Iraq housing US troops.
A Ukrainian passenger plane came down shortly after takeoff on Wednesday, with Western officials suggesting it had been downed -- possibly accidentally -- by an Iranian missile.
France, Britain and Germany are scrambling to keep alive a 2015 deal that reined in Tehran’s nuclear program, which US President Donald Trump walked out of in 2018.
Iran has dropped espionage charges against Adelkhah but she still faces charges of spreading “propaganda against the political system” and “conspiracy against national security”, her lawyer said this week.
Iran does not recognize Adelkhah’s dual French-Iranian nationality and has lashed out at Paris for what it has described as “interference” in the cases of the academics, both from Sciences Po University in Paris.
Marchal is also accused of “collusion against national security,” according to his lawyer.
The two researchers are not the only foreign academics behind bars in Iran -- Australian Kylie Moore-Gilbert of the University of Melbourne is serving a 10-year sentence on espionage charges.
Sciences Po said late last year that Adelkhah and Moore-Gilbert had begun a hunger strike. Moore-Gilbert has issued a plea to Prime Minister Scott Morrison to work for her release.
Tehran is still holding several other foreigners in high-profile cases, including British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Mohammad Bagher Namazi.

München/Berlin (dpa) - Das Ringen um die umstrittene Lieferung einer Siemens-Signalanlage für ein Kohlebergwerk in Australien geht in die Schlussrunde.
Heute demonstriert die Klimaschutzbewegung Fridays for Future vor Büros des Unternehmens in mehreren deutschen Städten - unter anderem ab 12.00 Uhr vor der Konzernzentrale in München. Zudem treffen sich Siemens-Chef Joe Kaeser und Luisa Neubauer, Aktivistin bei Fridays for Future. Der Konzern hatte am Donnerstag eine Einladung an die Klimaaktivistin bestätigt.
Hintergrund der Debatte ist ein Auftrag zur Lieferung einer Zugsignalanlage für eine geplante riesige Kohlemine in Australien, den Siemens erhalten hat. Klimaschützer fordern von Siemens, auf das Geschäft zu verzichten. Nach Protesten hatte Konzernchef Kaeser Mitte Dezember angekündigt, den Auftrag auf den Prüfstand zu stellen. Die Entscheidung könnte noch in dieser Woche fallen, wie aus dem Unternehmensumfeld zu hören ist. Kreisen zufolge hat das Geschäft ein Volumen von rund 20 Millionen Euro.
Neubauer sagte der „Augsburger Allgemeinen“ (Freitag), dass Siemens Klimaneutralität anstrebe und zugleich das in Australien geplante Großprojekt mit Technik ausrüsten wolle, sei ein eklatanter Widerspruch, der durch nichts zu rechtfertigen sei: „Als Konzern, der verstanden hat – oder vorgibt, zu verstehen, was die menschengemachte Klimakrise bedeutet – ist es nicht zu rechtfertigen, an einem Projekt wie der Adani-Mine festzuhalten.“
Von Siemens hieß es zu dem für Freitag geplanten Gespräch: „Wir nehmen das Thema sehr ernst und nehmen uns die notwendige Zeit, unterschiedliche Perspektiven zu hören und zu diskutieren.“
Nick Heubeck von Fridays for Future bewertete das Gesprächsangebot des Konzerns und die Chancen, etwas zu bewirken, positiv. „Wir haben so einen massiven Druck in Deutschland und Australien, dass ich mir bei einem Volumen von 20 Millionen Euro gut vorstellen kann, dass Siemens die in unseren Augen vernünftige Entscheidung trifft.“
Der indische Industriekonzern Adani will in Australien eines der größten Kohlebergwerke der Welt aufbauen, das aus fünf Untertageminen und sechs Tagebaustätten bis zu 60 Millionen Tonnen Kohle pro Jahr fördern soll. Das Projekt wird von Umweltschützern seit Jahren bekämpft.
In Deutschland sind für Freitag laut Heubeck rund 30 Aktionen von Fridays for Future geplant, die allerdings nicht alle einen direkten Bezug zu Siemens haben. Vor Büros des Konzerns soll es ihm zufolge am Freitag unter anderem in München, Erlangen, Augsburg, Erfurt, Konstanz, Kassel, Mannheim und Dortmund Aktionen geben.

Howard Smith Wharves chief executive Luke Fraser said there was a ""small amount of damage"" to the venue following the shooting, but the bar was open for business on Monday evening.
""No one was injured as the incident occurred when the venue was closed and no guests were present. One staff member was inside at the time and thankfully was unharmed,"" he said.
""The venue sustained a small amount of damage; however, this was repaired in time to return to
business as usual from 5pm yesterday.
""We are continuing to assist police with their investigation and as a precaution have put in place
additional security measures.""
The shooting occurred about 2am and the bullets came from a dinghy carrying three or four people.
On Monday afternoon, Acting Detective Inspector Steve Hatton said it was still too early to tell what the motive may have been or whether the shots came from more than one weapon.
Inspector Hatton said police were also looking at whether the shooting was linked to a suspicious early-morning fire last month but at this stage could not say.
Witnesses or anyone with information are urged to contact Policelink on 13 14 44 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
He added that even though it did not appear members of the public were being targeted, police were working with management of venues in the popular area to ensure their safety.
CCTV footage from before the December 21 fire captured a man throwing an object through a window that was believed to have started the blaze.
The flames were extinguished within 20 minutes after firefighters were called about 4.30am and furniture was damaged at the rear of the venue.
Mr Percival's opened as usual on December 21, despite the damage the venue sustained.

A staff member was inside Mr Percival's bar early on Monday morning when a gunman fired multiple shots into the Howard Smith Wharves venue from a boat in the Brisbane River, police have confirmed.
Howard Smith Wharves has responded by looking into increasing its security measures after Mr Percival's was the victim of an attack by a lone arsonist less than three weeks ago.

The shooting occurred about 2am and the bullets came from a dinghy carrying three or four people.
Nobody was injured, with the Boundary Street bar closed to the public at the time of the attack, but a staff member inside the business had a lucky escape.
Howard Smith Wharves chief executive Luke Fraser said there was ""a small amount of damage"" to the bar.
""Safety is our top priority and thankfully no one was injured as it occurred outside opening hours with no guests inside,"" he said.
""Emergency services were immediately called to the scene and we praise the efforts and swift response of police.
""We are assisting police with their investigation and working with them to implement increased security measures.""

On Monday afternoon, Acting Detective Inspector Steve Hatton said it was still too early to tell what the motive may have been or whether the shots came from more than one weapon.
Inspector Hatton said police were also looking at whether the shooting was linked to a suspicious early-morning fire last month but at this stage could not say.
Witnesses or anyone with information are urged to contact Policelink on 13 14 44 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
He added that even though it did not appear members of the public were being targeted, police were working with management of venues in the popular area to ensure their safety.
CCTV footage from before the December 21 fire captured a man throwing an object through a window that was believed to have started the blaze.
The flames were extinguished within 20 minutes after firefighters were called about 4.30am and furniture was damaged at the rear of the venue.
Mr Percival's opened as usual on December 21, despite the damage the venue sustained.

How the rest of the world marked the New Year
Why you can trust Sky News
Spectacular firework displays have lit up skies over some of the world's best-known landmarks - from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
Here's a look at how cities across the globe have marked a brand-new decade.
Anchorage, Alaska
Happy New Year! Make a wish... ☄️
Officer T. Yoon's #dashcam caught a pretty amazing meteor landing in #Anchorage on December 21st. Now we're sharing it here just in time for 2020, which means you just saw a shooting star. May luck be on your side! pic.twitter.com/9MSQ9KKW7i

Nearly 24 hours after Samoa first rang in 2020, Alaska's largest city welcomed the new decade with an organised fireworks display.
The police department wished its remote population a happy New Year by posting dramatic footage of a meteor falling to earth nearby, recently captured by a squad car's dashcam.
It invited people to make a lucky wish on the ""shooting star"".

New York's Times Square drops the glitter ball
In Times Square, thousands of lucky revellers gathered to see the famous glitter ball drop.
Alanis Morissette, the Korean pop group BTS and rap-pop star Post Malone were among those performing in the heart of Manhattan.
On a serious note, high school science teachers and students highlighted the importance of tackling climate change as they pressed the button that begins the 2020 countdown.
A whopping 1,360kg of confetti and pyrotechnics soon followed.

There was a strong turnout at Brazil's Copacabana beach come midnight - with three million people watching a 14-minute extravaganza boasting 15,422kg of fireworks.
Music, drinks and religious rituals were held on the shore, with many following tradition and dressing in white - symbolising their hope for peace.

Many are set to stay on the beach until sunrise, when they will take their first dip of 2020 in the ocean and wash away their troubles from the year before.

Berlin

There were plenty of fireworks in Berlin - but this wasn't the case in some German cities
Celebrations in Germany's capital centred on the Brandenburg Gate.
In other cities, such as Munich and Hamburg, citizens were actually banned from having their own private firework displays amid concerns about the environment.
Paris

Crippling transport strikes didn't dent the party spirit in France, with upbeat Parisians using their bikes and scooters to head down to the Champs-Elysee for a firework display.
Security was tight, with police setting up a perimeter around the famous avenue. Traffic restrictions were also in force, and alcohol was banned.

Fireworks burst from world's tallest building
Not one, not two, but seven different fireworks displays were taking place across Dubai - with hundreds of thousands gathering at the 828m (2,716ft) tall Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, to mark 2020's arrival.
Dubai is especially popular with tourists from Europe and Russia at this time of year as they try to escape the winter.
In an attempt to keep the massive crowds safe, police set up walkways around the Burj Khalifa for male-only groups - separating them from families and women.
Jakarta

Thousands braved the rain in Indonesia
Not everyone was blessed with good weather, unfortunately. In Indonesia's capital, torrential rains dampened the spirits of tens of thousands of revellers as they waited for fireworks.
Events in other areas were also affected by fears that Anak Krakatau, an active volcano, may be about to have a large eruption.
Hong Kong

The New Year celebrations were overshadowed by recent protests, with thousands of people breaking out into pro-democracy chants shortly after midnight.
There were no fireworks this year on the neon-lit promenades of Victoria Harbour for the first time in a decade, with officials citing security concerns.
Instead, there was a light show starring the city's tallest skyscrapers - with small-scale pyrotechnics launched from rooftops along the waterfront.

Celebrations in Australia were clouded by the recent deadly wildfires across the country, with officials in Sydney deciding to press ahead with their multimillion-dollar display.
There had been calls for the event to be cancelled in solidarity with fire-hit areas of New South Wales, but the city's mayor said planning had begun 15 months ago, the event had already been paid for, and it would give a boost to the economy.
Elsewhere in Australia, several towns in the east cancelled their celebrations altogether as naval vessels and military helicopters helped firefighters rescue those fleeing the fires.

Bushfire emergency
Statutory tort for serious invasions of privacy
Listen
The Australian Government made an emergency declaration under the Privacy Act 1988 in January 2020in response to the bushfires across Australia.The declaration expired on 20 January 2021.
While the declaration was in force, if an Australian Government agency or private sector organisation covered by the Privacy Act believed that you had been impacted by the bushfires, they were permitted to handle your personal information for several purposes that may not otherwise have been allowed.
These purposes must have directly related to the Commonwealth’s response to the bushfire emergency, such as:
identifying individuals who were or may be injured, missing or deceased as a result of the bushfire emergency, or were otherwise involved in the emergency
assisting impacted individuals to obtain services such as medical treatment, health services, financial assistance or other humanitarian services
assisting law enforcement with the bushfire emergency
coordinating or managing the emergency
ensuring that a person who was responsible for an individual involved in the emergency was appropriately informed about the individual and the emergency response to the individual.
Agencies and organisations were limited in who they could disclose personal information to under these provisions. If you think that your personal information was mishandled under the declaration you can make a privacy complaint.
More information is available in our advice for agencies and organisations or through our enquiries team.

Incident Status Update
——
Page Updated January 17, 10:21 AEST
On the 11th of January 2020, Canva became aware of a list of approximately 4 million Canva accounts containing user passwords stolen as part of the May 24 breach (see notes below, dated June 1, 10:13 AEST). The passwords had been decrypted and recently shared online.
As unchanged passwords might be used to access Canva accounts, we responded immediately to restrict access to Canva logins, and commenced work to both invalidate unchanged passwords, and notify users with unencrypted passwords in the list.
What we know
It has been 7 months since malicious individuals gained access to our encrypted password data and made that information available on the internet. In that time it appears that they have been using their resources to try and crack those passwords. Approximately 4 million Canva accounts affected by the May 2019 incident have now had their passwords decrypted.
What is Canva doing about it?
Over the past 7 months, we have sent out a variety of communications informing our affected users how they can secure their accounts. If you have proactively changed your Canva password in that period then you will not need to change it again.
On 2020-01-12, we reset the passwords of all users who had not changed their password following 2019-05-24. These users will be required to change their password when they next log in to Canva. Because we are forcibly resetting passwords, we are also directly notifying recently active Canva users whose passwords have been reset.
We are also notifying those Canva users whose passwords appear to have been decrypted so that they can take steps to protect other accounts where the same password has been used.
What this means for our affected users
Affected users will be required to set a new password to continue using Canva. Please note that if your password has been reset, it does not mean that your account has been accessed by attackers. We are taking this precaution to protect your Canva account.
Follow our password guidelines here. Once again, we suggest you:
Create hard to guess passwords with a combination of letters (upper and lower case, numbers and special characters).
Use a password manager to manage all your Internet passwords.
Make sure you use a safe and secure password that has not been used on other sites or accounts before.
Users with a valid recovery address will be able to recover passwords using the regular password reset procedure. Users without valid email addresses will need to use the manual recovery procedure.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

Page Updated August 10, 23:25 AEST
Some of our users have recently been notified by haveibeenpwned.com (HIBP) and Firefox Monitor of a security breach that occurred on the 24th May 2019. You can read more about the attack, how we responded, and what we did (see notes below, dated June 1, 10:13 AEST).
The content of these notifications are accurate, and we’re grateful to HIBP and Firefox Monitor for the service they provide to the community.
For some people with Canva accounts it appears that this security notification has come as a surprise. This is regrettable. As part of our incident response, one of the first things we did was to try to contact affected users via email and through in-app alerts.
The HIBP notification has led some users to ask if their passwords were compromised. The simple answer is no. What was accessed was individually salted and bcrypt-hashed passwords. For non-technical users, this is like a super-secure one-way door that converts your password into something that is incredibly hard to convert back into the original password, even with the strongest computers.
The way we store passwords makes password guessing incredibly difficult but it’s not impossible, and it’s easier if you have easy-to-guess passwords, such as password1, 123456! or Alex1997. So to protect our users on Canva, and elsewhere, we’ve requested all our users to change their passwords on Canva, and anywhere else they’ve used the same password. To help all our users avoid this risk, we’ve partnered with 1Password to offer one year of free access to their password manager service, as well as implemented stronger password checks within Canva.
Since the incident, we’ve introduced a number of internal changes to protect your data. Working closely with leading cyber security consultancy, Mandiant and other partners, we’ve identified the extent of the attack and the causes of it, and made changes to our systems to build an additional layer of protection for our users. We’ll be providing a postmortem of the incident in due course, but in the meantime if you have any further questions, or would like to learn more about the measures we’ve taken to ensure your data is secure on Canva, please feel free to reach out to us.

June 1, 10:13 AEST
Following an investigation with cyber security experts, we now have a better understanding of the impact of the attack and want to provide as much context as we can to our community.
On Friday 24th May 2019, we detected a malicious attack on our systems, which we stopped as it was occurring. Our first response was to lock down Canva, then notify authorities and users that the breach had occurred. Because the intruder was interrupted mid-attack they also took a different tactic to most security incidents and tweeted about the attack, which required a rapid communication response.
Since then we have worked with cyber security experts and authorities, such as the FBI, to help protect our users, and are communicating the latest information below.
What did the attacker do?
They accessed information from our profile database for up to 139 million users. The profile database contains usernames, names, email addresses, country, and optionally, user-supplied data about their city and/or homepage URL which was available through their public profile.
They accessed cryptographically protected passwords (these were individually salted and hashed with bcrypt) for any of those users with username/password logins.
They claimed to have obtained OAuth login tokens for users who signed in via Google. Our OAuth tokens are encrypted with AES128 and the encryption keys are securely stored elsewhere. We have found no evidence they downloaded the OAuth tokens or tried to access the keys.
They briefly viewed files with partial credit card and payment data. We found no evidence these files were stolen. Files contained partial credit card data from before September 28, 2016 (name, expiry date, last 4 digits, card brand and card country), and payment histories from before September 16, 2017 that contained transaction dollar amounts, dates, and IDs for some payments for users and contributors. These limited card details cannot be used for payments. Canva never stores full credit card details.
Designs and images are securely stored in separate systems. There has been no indication that any user designs or images have been accessed.
What is Canva doing about it?
We continue to invest heavily in security. We intend to publish a technical post mortem of the incident once our investigations are complete. Our first priority, though, is to protect our users. Here’s what we’re doing:
Notifying our users: We want our users to know that they’ve been affected. We’ve directly contacted users via email, but some users have out-of-date or incorrect email details so we have also used in-app notifications and the press to alert users to the breach. We are following up on our initial notification with individual emails to each user outlining what data was accessed.
Prompting users to change passwords: We’ve asked all users who had passwords set before the attack to change them, and are adding rules to help users set stronger ones.
Resetting OAuth tokens: We’ve worked with our partners to make sure all active login tokens that existed prior to the breach are reset. These users will be prompted to reconnect their Canva account.
Coordinating with partners: We are working with partner agencies to share information about the attack, identify the risk to users, and coordinate responses. For example, we’re alerting the email abuse teams of major providers to make it harder for attackers to phish our users.
Partnering with 1Password: While we recommend that our users use different passwords for each site they use, we know that’s hard. We have partnered with 1Password to offer a year free to Canva users who don’t already use their service.
What can Canva users do?
Change your password: If you have a password on Canva and haven’t done so already, we are recommending that everyone change their password on Canva, and if you used the same password on other sites you should change those too.
Report suspicious emails: As a precaution, we’re encouraging everyone to be wary of suspicious emails. Attackers often use creative methods to trick you into handing over your personal information. If you do receive any emails that you believe are suspicious, do not click on them and do not respond. We encourage you to flag them with your email provider.
Use a password manager: We recommend you use a password manager such as 1Password or Google Chrome to generate and remember a unique, secure password for each site you use.
Update your Google/Facebook login if we’ve disconnected it: If you sign in using Facebook or Google we may have reset your login. Just login again to get back into your Canva account.
Update your contact details: Once you have logged in to Canva, please add or update your contact details so we can always contact you about your account.
A final word
We are deeply sorry that this has happened. Everyone at Canva has been on the receiving end of updates like this, and at a personal level we know how upsetting it can be. We want to rebuild and regain the trust you have given us, and will work hard to earn it.

Log4j2 Vulnerability Update
On 10th December, 2021 AEDT , we were made aware of a remote code execution vulnerability ( CVE-2021-44228 ) related to Apache Log4j2 , a popular Java logging library. We undertook a thorough investigation to confirm that Canva desktop and mobile applications are not impacted by this vulnerability, and implemented layered mitigations to protect Canva systems and services. We are also working with our service providers to make sure they are taking appropriate action. At this time, there is no action required from Canva customers . We are actively monitoring the issue and will provide status updates upon significant change.
Protect your account
At Canva, we are committed to protecting your data and privacy. To help with this, we recommend doing the following for added protection to your account: Log in using your Apple, Facebook, or Google account Using a social login means you don't need to set or remember a password. After you log in to your provider, they're able to tell Canva who you are. Use a password manager Passwords should be unique and unpredictable. Using a password manager is the easiest way to set a strong password. It also allows using different strong passwords for all your logins without having to remember all of them. Pick a strong password If you can't use a password manager, we recommend using a password that’s at least 8 characters . Avoid using the following as passwords as well because they’re easy to guess: A word by itself Recent years Straight rows of keys Sequences like “abc” or “6543” Repeats like “aaa” or “abcabcabc” Short keyboard patterns Names and surnames Context like the website name Dates We also recommend changing your password from time to time. Set up Multi-Factor Authentication When multi-factor authentication is set up, you’ll need to enter the 6-digit code generated by your authenticator app each time you log in to Canva to verify it’s you. This helps ensure that you’re the only one with access to your account. See Setting up multi-factor authentication to learn how to set it up. Sign out from all devices By signing out of all sessions, you can prevent other people from accessing your account without your permission. For instance, if you forget to log out of your account on a public computer, someone else may use that computer and gain access to your account. To learn how to do this, go to Log out of Canva . Use SAML authentication Canva Teams and Canva for Education can use SAML to authenticate users via Single Sign-On (SSO) . Team administrators and owners can set this up.
I can’t log in

If you’re experiencing SSO-related login issues, learn what to do when you can’t log in using SSO I can’t receive my login code Check your spam, junk, or promotions folder—it may have been filtered there by mistake. If your login code’s not there, check why I’m not receiving emails with login, sign up, or verification codes . Alternatively, you can set up a passkey as an extra layer of security for your account. It also makes logging in easier and faster. I don’t have access to my email This usually happens when you’re using your work email and you’ve left the company or organisation. Learn what to do when you can’t access your email . I’m being required to enter a login code after entering my password For added security, you may be required to enter a login code after entering your password when logging in. This helps protect your account by verifying your identity. If you prefer, you can also log in using alternative methods like Google or Passkey. The Google or Facebook authorisation pop-up closes automatically This can happen if a pop-up blocker is turned on. To fix it, turn off any pop-up blockers and try logging in again. Still stuck?

Australian airline traffic slows as outbreak shatters demand

The number of flights to and from Australia has fallen by a fifth over the past six weeks as the coronavirus outbreak shatters travel demand and shapes up as the most serious threat to the global airline industry in over a decade.
Flights scheduled between Australia and China have dived 90 per cent, from 198 in the week starting January 20 to just 13 flights this week, according to figures from industry data firm OAG.

The data, provided to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald, shows the total number of scheduled international flights in and out of Australia falling from 4328 in the last week of January to 3518 this week - a decline of 18 per cent.
However, that also reflects the end of the peak holiday travel period, with the decline closer to 10 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
Australia barred non-residents who have been in China during the past 14 days from travelling to Australia on February 20 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is set to remain in place at leastuntil March 7.
Meanwhile, both business travellers and holiday makers are cancelling travel plans in and around Asia, behaviour that threatens to spread to other regions as the virus does.
Qantas has suspended its flights to China.

The International Air Transport Association has forecast global air traffic to fall 4.7 per cent this year because of the virus outbreak, which will be the first overall decline since the global financial crisis in 2008.
Peter Harbison, executive chairman of industry intelligence firm Centre for Aviation, said the virus could have a lasting impact on the Asia-Pacific airline market if it continues for much longer.
“Grounding fleets and that sort of thing is for an airline - which lives on cash flow - quite quickly deadly,"" he said.
“Several of the independent airlines will find it very hard if this continues for another month or two to even stay in the market.”
However government bailouts for struggling airlines was likely in China and South Korea, where low-cost carriers were particularly affected, he said.
South Korea now has the most COVID-19 cases outside of China, rising to more than 2000 on Friday. Jetstar suspended its recently launched Gold Coast to Seoul service on Thursday.
Some airlines are scrambling to cut airfares in an effort to fill their jets, with Air New Zealand on Friday selling tickets for as low as $66 on trans-Tasman flights, which have been hit with a collapse in demand from Chinese tourists.
Cancellations from mainland China are the biggest driver behind the fall in international capacity from Australia.
Qantas suspended its services from Sydney to Shanghai and Beijing on February 9. The airline had already decided to drop Sydney-Beijing from its network, from this week, before the virus outbreak.
Along with a fall in flights from China, OAG's data shows there has also been a sharp decline from Hong Kong, down 50 per cent to just 66 flights this week, with Cathay Pacific operating half as many services (36) and Virgin Australia pulling up stumps on flights from Melbourne from February 11.
Mr Harbison said airlines would also be vulnerable to a medium-term downturn in demand if the coronavirus crisis inflicts lasting damage on the global economic activity, making recovery from the current shock harder.
Qantas has said the virus will cost it up to $150 million, Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand expect it will cost up to $75 million each.

Mine site protest
Around 50 Extinction Rebellion protesters have got on to an open cast mine site to shut down work for a second day.
They scaled fences at the Banks Group’s Bradley site in County Durham at around 8am on Thursday, despite the presence of security guards with dogs.
Protester Paul Shepherd, a 66-year-old retired GP, said the first moments of the occupation were “scary”.
He said they made it clear they would not attempt to damage any of the site’s heavy plant equipment and their intention is only to occupy the site to shut down work.
Dr Shepherd, from nearby Lanchester, said they had stated their intentions to security guards and on that basis, the dogs had not been released on them.
He said: “Our aim is to highlight the continued use of these fossil fuels and to stimulate conversation about how it is so important to make change.

“There are lots of reasons to maintain the status quo but science shows we have to change rapidly in order to prevent catastrophic climate change.
“There are lot of highly motivated people here from all walks of life.
“We hope Banks shareholders sell their shares or put pressure on the management to divest from coal.
“Money does speak.”
On Wednesday, Extinction Rebellion campaigners blocked access to the site, with some protesters dressed as canaries sitting in cages at the mine entrance.
They stated their opposition to Banks’ planning application to expand the site.
The Banks mining company said coal is necessary for the steel and cement industries, and if it is not produced in Britain even more would be brought in from Australia or Russia.
In a statement, company spokesman Mark Dowdall called the protesters “privileged fools” who had put themselves and others at risk, and he condemned them for stopping local workers from doing their jobs.
He added: “Until viable alternatives are in place, five to six million tonnes of coal will still be needed each year in the UK as a raw material for our steel and cement industries, and domestic production of this essential mineral offsets the amount of coal that British industry is forced to import, which brings with it significantly higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions.”

'You remember how good it was': Longmire's love for Origin

Normal text sizeLarger text sizeVery large text size
All Stars mentor John Longmire has praised AFL coaches' unanimous support for the bushfire relief match as the push for State of Origin to return gathers momentum.
Longmire will coach the All Stars in their one-off game against Victoria on February 28, when the nation's best descend on Marvel Stadium to help raise funds for those affected by the national bushfire crisis.

The cause resulted in all of Longmire's counterparts offering their best players and any assistance possible.
Competition was even fierce to get into the coaches' box, with Longmire revealing ""every coach I spoke to said they would love to be involved"".
It begs the question as to whether Origin, which hasn't been staged in any form since 1999 apart from a Hall of Fame tribute match in 2008, could return as a regular part of the AFL calendar.
GWS captain Stephen Coniglio declared on Tuesday it is definitely worth pursuing, while Adelaide's Rory Laird expressed similar sentiments.

Longmire cautioned he was ""the wrong person to ask and the reality is it's not my decision"", but freely admitted there is an immense upside to representative football of any description.
""I've spoken to our senior players about what it was like to play AFLX. Even though that wasn't as big as what this is, it was certainly an experience they enjoyed,"" Longmire said.

""They loved that chance to play with players from other clubs and some of the AFL's best.
""That makes you reflect and you remember how good it was to play Origin, even just to run out at training or sit in the same changing room [as greats from other clubs].
""You've got to give those opportunities, if you're able to, to the new generation coming through.""
The 2012 premiership coach, who grew up on a Balldale farm near the Murray River, remarkably represented both Victoria and NSW in Origin contests during 1990.

Longmire joked his pre-match address to the All Stars would be showing highlights of the famous 1990 upset, when his eight-goal haul helped NSW cause a boilover against a star-studded Victoria.
""The late great Teddy Whitten was heavily involved and he wasn't happy that night. I don't know who the equivalent of Teddy is this year for the Vics, but we'll have to wait and see whether they're happy or not,"" he said.
Sydney's coach stressed it was important everybody remembers why next week's game is being held.
""We had to cut short a couple of training sessions because of the smoke. We just got on with it. It's nothing compared to what a lot of people went through,"" he said.

How we are still waiting for answers about sex and power

The First Stone
Helen Garner
Picador, $32.99
Generation F
Virginia Trioli
Scribner, $24.99
By the time The First Stone was published in 1995, Helen Garner was a star. She occupied an unusual place in the firmament of Australian literature, both a literary writer and a popular one. Her readers trusted her to tell the truth, even in fiction.
My boyfriend gave me his copy of Garner’s Monkey Grip in 1979, a gift at the beginning of our relationship when I shared a house with a couple of smackheads in Sydney’s Glebe. He told me a friend of his was in the book and thought it might resonate, a warning about life with a bundle of junkies. It didn’t leave my bedside table for years. Every turn of phrase, every betrayal by Javo. I could recite whole passages and gave copies as a gift to anyone who, like me, came late to Garner. Everything she wrote was the best book I’d ever read. The boyfriend became my husband.
Helen Garner's The First Stone provoked furious debate.

DARREN JAMES
When The First Stone was published, Garner’s first big foray into non-fiction, I’d been a journalist for nearly 15 years. I was a Garner advocate, what we might now call a superfan, and ecstatic to be asked to write about Garner’s interpretation of what happened when the master at Ormond College was accused of indecent assault against two young residents. I expected a massive truth bomb about power relationships between men and women, the answers to “some questions about sex and power” as the book promised.
Now both The First Stone and its response, Generation F by ABC veteran journalist Virginia Trioli, are republished. The Garner book’s foreword is by 7.30’s Leigh Sales, an excerpt from Garner’s biographer Bernadette Brennan as afterword.
On its release, Virginia Trioli's Generation F felt like a lifeline for women.

EDDIE JIM
Trioli’s has new material at the beginning and end. These books beg to be read today now sexual harassment and assault are again in the spotlight because of #MeToo, a social movement designed to draw attention to the systematic sexual abuse of women by men.
No question republication of The First Stone will be a hit. Last year, the University of Melbourne offered masterclasses on Great Books. Glyn Davis, former vice-chancellor of the university and now chief executive officer of the Paul Ramsay Foundation, chose The First Stone and 120 participants turned up, some current students, mainly older graduates, many who’d appeared under aliases in the book.
For two hours, the debate was as furious as it had been two decades earlier. One bloke who went said he was surprised by “the continuing depth of feeling about the case and Helen Garner’s account, and the extraordinarily detailed knowledge of events” that so many who went to the seminar brought to the discussion. Lara McKay, the Master of Ormond College, answered questions afterwards. She told me it's “unhelpful to believe Ormond is somehow immune from sexual harassment and assault and we encourage everyone in the College community to call out any action or behaviour if they see it”. That’s the lasting impact of the complaints of the two women residents.
CREDIT:
Do these two books have that same impact? Garner’s narrative drive still grips, Trioli’s reporting is meticulous. I guessed the topic of Leigh Sales’ foreword, the night a creep she barely knew kissed her on the lips as she hosted a black-tie medical research fundraiser. As Sales writes, “I wished I had slapped his face; instead I chirped through my introductory remarks.” Trioli too reveals the times she played along and the times she stood up.
These are two of the most powerful women in Australian media and they too have played along, not years ago but now. Women have always done that, have always, as Trioli writes so powerfully, kept men’s secrets.
On its release, Generation F felt like a lifeline to the future for women. This was strong long-form journalism – Trioli spoke to scores of women, read reports, examined the legal frontiers of the war between men and women. I checked out a few of the women she interviewed – one now a judge, others too have soared. But then as now, Generation F did something much more. It made it clear The First Stone had flaws. It sympathised with those who loved Garner and her work and then encapsulated those errors of authorial judgment: combining fact with fiction, conflating desire with sexism, not acknowledging the power of institutions.
A friend reminded me that in those days we had hope and optimism, we were Generation F. We were not prudes nor did we need to be reprimanded by older feminists. Trioli’s book gave us hope but that’s gone and she details the work we still have to do. Maybe the final report from Australia’s Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins’ national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces, due soon, will have answers.

Which brings us back to the The First Stone, where Garner wonders why these two young women “went to the cops” and refused to deal with it themselves. Garner and friends were scandalised by the decision of the young women to turn this into a legal matter.
“I got on the phone to women friends of my age . . . they had all noticed the [news] item and been unsettled by it.” Shorter version: why didn’t the women handle it themselves? Midway Garner introduces us to a male tutor who defends the master of the college: “My accountant’s a woman. When she heard about the case, that it was an accusation of groping, she said to me, “What? You mean that’s it?”
Over my life, I’ve witnessed young women groped by men. One night, in a Spanish bar in Sydney’s CBD, a man physically harassed my university lecturer. I tipped a plate of scalding churros into his shirt. Another night, a copy kid doing some photocopying waited until she got into the bathroom to burst into tears after a senior bloke came up behind her and pressed his erect penis against her. When he lost his job, finally, he blamed a feminist conspiracy.
Spectral feminist conspiracies always appear, when men are being prosecuted for their conduct, men who range from the badly behaved to the criminal. Garner used that trope too in her construction of events at Ormond College. The night of the inaugural Larry Adler lecture titled The Fate of the First Stone in 1995, I went as a fan. But sometime during the speech, Garner revealed the name of one of those feminist conspirators, Jenna Mead. She said: “Before I even wrote it, Dr Jenna Mead tried to block my attempts to research the story.”
Scandalous. Who was this harridan who’d attempted to silence the greatest Australian writer of our generation? Garner said Mead had accused her of “having ‘invented dialogues’ and written ‘hypothetical meetings with imaginary characters’”. How could anyone question Garner, whose gift for truth telling was unparalleled?
The next morning, I called Mead at the University of Tasmania. She told me Garner had turned her into six or seven characters in the book “which encouraged people to view the events as a feminist conspiracy instead of recognising [her] as one woman trying to help students in the best way she knew”. The phone interview lasted five hours.
I rang Garner to ask if it was true, had she turned one character into several? Her response: who told you and then, my lawyers made me. If she’d said, I have every right to shape the narrative because I’m a great writer and I did it on legal advice and been clear from the outset, then The First Stone could have stood as “creative non-fiction”. But this was Garner the Great and we’d believed her.
Maybe all great art is a fabrication but not much great art pretends to be fact when it’s fiction. For me and for other readers, this was Garner’s great betrayal, the gifted artist who had the capacity to nail the story but didn’t. The First Stone emerged as ultimately untrustworthy. Garner had squandered our faith in her.
I recommend you read The First Stone and Generation F one after the other, slippery but compelling followed by factual and bleak; and one other book you should read, unlikely to be republished. In 1997, Jenna Mead edited a book of essays, Bodyjamming: Sexual Harassment, Feminism and Public Life, where one of the complainants against the master of Ormond College speaks. She writes of her coverage in the media: “I had somehow contrived to become simultaneously a frigid, slutty, lesbian, sexually irresistible, terrifying, puritanical, man-hating, vengeful victim.”
Your local library has a copy. It answers some of those questions about sex and power Garner couldn’t.

China travel ban extended as Morrison pledges for the safety of Australians
February 21, 2020 - 7:20AM
Australia has extended its China travel ban for another week amid ongoing fears over the spread of the coronavirus.
The extension prevents tourists and students from entering the country until at least February 29, but Australian citizens and permanent residents are still able to travel.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision has been made to ensure the safety of Australians.
Meantime, at least six people evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have been isolated at a Darwin quarantine facility after showing coronavirus symptoms.
They were among 170 Australians flown to the Northern Territory from Japan.

Huawei ban a 'thorny issue' hurting China-Australia relations, says ambassador

China's ambassador to Australia has labelled the government's ban on Huawei's involvement in the rollout of next-generation 5G networks discriminatory and politically motivated, warning it remains a ""thorny issue"" in relations between Beijing and Canberra.
Ambassador Cheng Jingye's fresh criticism of Australia's 5G policy comes amid a diplomatic dispute between intelligence partners Britain and Australia stemming from the former's decision to allow the Chinese technology giant into its networks.
Chinese ambassador Cheng Jingye: ""It is discrimination against a Chinese company.""

On Monday, Mr Cheng said Australia's ban was ""politically motivated"" amid a global campaign against Huawei, led by the United States.
""It is discrimination against a Chinese company. At the same time, it doesn't serve the best interests of Australian companies and consumers,"" he told Sky News.""And it has become a sore point, or thorny issue, in bilateral relations as it damages mutual trust between the two sides.""
Hitting out at the ""smear campaign"" against Huawei and pressure on US allies, Mr Cheng praised Britain's approach.
""Despite external pressure, I think the UK has come up with a decision which will not exclude Huawei from participating at least in some parts of the 5G technology development, which I think is a sensible decision,"" he said.

In August 2018, Australia became the first country to bar the Chinese telecommunications giant from providing 5G technology. The prohibition on equipment vendors ""likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government"" preceded a similar move by the US.
Danielle Cave, deputy director of the international cyber policy centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, denied Australia's decision was politically motivated.
""It was a risk-based decision that weighed up advice from a range of government departments and agencies, including in-depth technical advice from [electronic intelligence agency] the Australian Signals Directorate,"" she said.
She predicted there would not be a policy change to allow ""high-risk vendors"" into Australia's 5G networks, even if Beijing maintained pressure on the government.
The question of how to handle the security risks has triggered a row between close allies after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson authorised Huawei to have a limited role in his country's rollout.
Earlier this month, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed that Labor MP Anthony Byrne, deputy chair of the Australian Parliament's intelligence and security committee, rebuked British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab over the issue in a private meeting in Canberra.
""How would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks? That's how we feel about Huawei,"" Mr Byrne told Mr Raab, according to sources in the room. Mr Byrne said British intelligence agencies were ""flat-out wrong"" to say Huawei could supply 5G equipment and not pose a threat to national security.
The ABC subsequently revealed Britain's high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadall, wrote to two parliamentary committee chairs to demand an explanation over the leak about the meeting. A planned trip to Britain by the intelligence and security committee has been cancelled.
China has continually complained about Australia's 5G ban since it came into effect. China's representatives at the World Trade Organisation have repeatedly branded it discriminatory and recently claimed the restrictions were now going beyond 5G and affecting involvement with existing networks.

Boris Johnson is coming under renewed pressure from key British allies over his controversial decision to give Chinese tech giant Huawei a role in building the UK’s 5G network.
A delegation of senior US officials – including Donald Trump’s acting chief of staff – are set to fly to London to raise their concerns directly with Number 10, according to the Daily Telegraph.
Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that MPs on Australia’s intelligence and security committee have pulled out of a visit to the UK next month following a diplomatic row with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.
Mick Mulvaney, who is leading the US delegation, is expected to call on the UK Government to change its decision on Huawei when they meet senior officials on Wednesday.

The Telegraph quoted a source close to the delegation as saying they expected to deliver a “bollocking” to British officials.
“One thing is on the agenda, and it’s not a trade deal – it is Huawei,” the source said.
The visit comes after an “apoplectic” President Trump reportedly vented his fury with Mr Johnson when the Prime Minister telephoned him to explain the UK’s decision last month.
The US has repeatedly warned that it would withhold intelligence-sharing from any ally which allowed Huawei access to its communications networks, which it regards as a national security threat.
The furious row has led to Mr Johnson reportedly delaying a planned visit to Washington which had been expected to take place over the spring.
A Number 10 spokesman insisted on Friday that the Prime Minister is still looking forward to travelling to the US but is “currently focused on driving through the Government’s ambitious domestic agenda”.

American concerns about China were underlined by US Defence Secretary Mark Esper who accused Beijing of stealing Western know-how while using its power to intimidate smaller neighbours.
“The Communist Party and its associated organs, including the People’s Liberation Army, are increasingly operating in theatres outside its borders, including Europe, and seeking advantage by any means, and at any cost,” he said in speech to an international security conference in Munich.
Mr Johnson has faced criticism for downgrading Britain’s presence at the event, with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and MI6 Chief Alex Younger pulling out and newly-appointed Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly attending instead.
Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herald said the Australian intelligence and security committee had abruptly called off its visit next month when members had been expected meet their UK counterparts as well as senior intelligence and security figures.
The paper said the cancellation followed a letter from a senior Australian civil servant to committee chairman Andrew Hastie, rebuking him over a leak of details of a meeting with Mr Raab when MPs on the committee confronted him over the Huawei decision.
Australia – which, like the US, is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance – has banned the Chinese firm from its 5G network because of the potential national security implications.
Having hi-tech from high-risk vendors in our critical national infrastructure is wrong on many levels
Bob Seely MP
The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the British Government should take such concerns seriously, saying the country faces some “really serious strategic choices” when it comes to China.
“Personally, I would like to stand with countries that share the rule of law, human rights and the values I think are so important,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“That means standing with Australia and Canada. It also means standing with countries like France who have also rejected Huawei.
“The decisions we make today will affect how our children are governed in years to come.”
Tory MP Bob Seely, who was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the last parliament, said the role of Huawei should form part of the Government’s forthcoming foreign policy and defence review.
“Having hi-tech from high-risk vendors in our critical national infrastructure is wrong on many levels – national security, personal data, Chinese leverage over the UK Government,” he said.
“The Aussies gave a very blunt opinion to the UK. The UK Government should be listening to the message our allies are giving, not moaning that they are giving it.”
A Government spokesman said: “We are clear-eyed about the challenge posed by Huawei, which is why we are banning them from sensitive and critical parts of the network and setting a strict 35% cap on market share.
“Our world-leading cyber security experts are satisfied that with our approach, and tough regulatory regime, any risk can be safely managed.”

Australia to look at US move to lift landmine restrictions

Australia will move to ensure its joint operations with the United States do not involve the use of anti-personnel landmines after Donald Trump lifted restrictions on the deadly weapons.
The decision by the US president reverses a 2014 Obama administration ban on the weapons, which applies everywhere in the world except for in the defence of South Korea.

A coalition of international aid and advocacy groups has written to Prime Minister Scott Morrison urging him to guarantee Australia’s joint exercises with US forces did not involve the use or transport of landmines.
As a signatory to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, the move has the potential to put Australia in a difficult position with its major ally.
Australia also has a stated commitment to the goal of a world free of landmines by 2025
The Australian Arms Control Coalition – which includes Save the Children, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Oxfam – called on the Australian Prime Minister to publicly condemn the decision by the United States.
“Australia has long been a strong supporter of mine action and is a state party to the APMBC and the Convention on Cluster Munitions,” the letter to Mr Morrison reads.
“Australia is also supporting efforts to reduce the number of deaths and injuries from landmines, cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war through bilateral aid partnership and through the United Nations Mine Action Service.
“Given these efforts by Australia, the announcement by the US must be condemned by all countries concerned with the horrific humanitarian impact of landmines.”
The Department of Defence said Australia would continue to conduct all of its military operations in accordance with its international, domestic and legal obligations.
“With regards to landmines, Australia is a State Party to the Mine Ban Convention and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), and meets all of its obligations under those Conventions,” a Defence spokesman said.
Defence said Australian forces were experienced at incorporating its weapons treaty obligations into joint operations with other militaries.
ADF personnel are not allowed to use cluster munitions, even when deployed with the forces of countries who are not signatories to the Cluster Munitions Convention.
Under the changes, US forces will now be able to use landmines “in exceptional circumstances”.
When announcing the decision on January 31, the Trump administration said the Obama Admistration's ban of the weapons put US troops “at a severe disadvantage”.

Final appeal over Pell child sex conviction set for March
The final appeal by Cardinal George Pell against his child sex abuse convictions will be held by Australia's High Court on March 11-12, the court announced Friday. It is the final avenue for the 78-year-old -- who is serving a six-year sentence for sexually assaulting two choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral in the 1990s -- to get out of jail. The former Vatican treasurer, who once helped elect popes, was found guilty by a jury in December 2018 of five charges of abusing the choirboys when he was the archbishop of Melbourne. He was sentenced the following March and lost a first appeal in August in Victoria state's Court of Appeal in a landmark decision that saw the judges split in a 2-1 verdict. That division -- which saw two judges back the jury's verdict and the dissenting judge side with Pell -- is at the forefront of his latest bid to overturn the convictions. The case pitted the most senior convicted Catholic child molester against a former choirboy now in his 30s, who two of the judges found to be ""very compelling"" and someone who ""was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth"". The third judge, however, found the victim's account ""contained discrepancies"" and there was a ""significant possibility"" Pell did not commit the offences. Court documents show his legal team are mounting two grounds of appeal, with the key argument being that the majority judges applied an ""erroneous judicial method"" in ""upholding with the jury's verdict"". The second contends there was not enough time for Pell to have molested the boys in the priests' sacristy during a five to six minute period after Sunday Mass ended and the area became a ""hive of activity"". The High Court receives about 500 appeal applications each year but only agrees to hear about 35. A spokesman said the High Court justices could announce a ruling on Pell's appeal at the end of the two-day hearing, or withhold judgement to a later date. During Pell's trial under a court-ordered veil of secrecy, the Vatican gradually removed him from top Church bodies with little explanation. Shortly after his conviction, Pell was removed from the so-called C9 Council of Cardinals that are effectively the Pope's cabinet and inner circle of advisers. The Vatican later dropped him as the church's finance chief but said it would avoid launching an investigation into his conduct until after all legal avenues are exhausted. Disgraced Catholic Cardinal George Pell was found guilty in 2018 of five charges of abusing choirboys when he was the archbishop of Melbourne

5G rollout
Why are Huawei and 5G such a big deal around the world?
The UK will use Huawei technology in its 5G network upgrade. Australia and the US have warned against this. Why? What are the pros and cons of going with Huawei? And what is 5G anyway?

Superfast mobile broadband is coming our way. But the race to bring us a 5G network has been caught up in the geopolitical storm between the West and China – with Chinese firm Huawei at its epicentre.
5G mobile technology will power the much-vaunted Internet of Things, when all connectable domestic devices (smartwatch to your fridge to your car to your washing machine) will be linked not just to the internet but to one another.
Yet the very technology required to bring us superfast mobile broadband will also make our network more vulnerable in new ways.
With 5G, for example, critical infrastructure such as hospitals and traffic lights will also be connected.
This helps explain why Britain's decision to use Huawei equipment in its network has upset officials in Australia and the US.
So what are the pros and cons of going with Huawei?

What is Huawei?
Huawei (pronounced wah-way) Technologies Co Ltd is a Chinese company founded by former military officer Ren Zhengfei in 1987 in Shenzhen, where it is still headquartered. It started out selling switching equipment to direct phone traffic through rural China but now produces smart devices, cloud services and telecommunications equipment. It surpassed Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone maker in 2018.
The company says it is private, with no links to the government – but who actually owns Huawei remains unclear. The operating company is not publicly listed and US researchers say it is owned by a holding company that is 99 per cent owned by an entity called a ""trade union committee"" and 1 per cent owned by Ren.
The researchers have found that if the ownership stake claimed by the trade union committee is genuine, and if the trade union and its committee function as trade unions generally function in China, then Huawei may be deemed effectively state-owned.
How big is the company?
It is claimed Huawei receives massive subsidies from the Chinese government. Analysis by The Wall Street Journal puts the figure at $75 billion. Huawei disputes this but will not specify the amount itself.
In 1997, it entered the Global System of Mobile communications (GSM) network, making equipment for 2G and 3G mobile systems.
The company is now estimated to supply 30 per cent of the world's mobile technology market, double the reach of its nearest rivals, Nokia and Ericsson. It employs 194,000 staff worldwide, 60,000 of them based in Shenzhen. Huawei says 45 per cent of its staff work on researching and developing new technologies.
In 2018, Huawei recorded revenues of $US105 billion ($157 billion) with profits of $US8.5 billion. For the first three-quarters of 2019, Huawei recorded total revenues of $US87 billion – up 24 per cent on the same period in 2018.
It operates in 170 countries but Ren says global dominance is not his intention. ""Huawei is not ambitious, we don't want to dominate the world,"" he told CNBC last year. It wants to be the world's leading supplier of the equipment that runs 5G networks enabling super-fast mobile broadband speeds.
What is 5G?
The G is for generation and the 5 is for fifth: 5G is the fifth generation of mobile broadband technology.
Key features are network speed and low latency, meaning minimal delays between the time it takes to click on a page and load it. It can handle many more connections at one time, meaning you won't lose signal next time you're at a concert or a footy game and everyone's trying to connect at once.
Ideally, mobile providers believe that 5G could enable you to download a feature film in 60 seconds and experience zero lag when gaming.
It could make other new technologies possible too, such as virtual surgeries, enabling traffic lights and cars to send signals to each other and so on.
Is Huawei the only 5G supplier?
No. There are three companies – Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson – that analysts say can provide 5G technology. Huawei has the lead in the total telecom equipment market share.
Why do we care right now?
China's 2017 National Intelligence Law says: ""All organisations and citizens shall support, assist, and co-operate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with the law."" The US and Australia believe that Huawei could be used by the Chinese government for espionage.
The US has lobbied its allies to ban Huawei, a move some see as a part of Washington's power struggle with Beijing and more recently, part of US President Donald Trump's trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Australia first banned Huawei from supplying equipment to the nascent National Broadband Network in 2012 under Julia Gillard.
In 2018, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull banned Huawei from taking part in the 5G rollout, on security advice.
The US and Australia lobbied Britain to ban Huawei from its 5G rollout but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused even if Huawei was a ""high-risk vendor"".

Why did the UK agree to go with Huawei?
British Telecom, known as BT, signed a deal with Huawei in 2005. BT told civil servants two years before it gave Huawei the contract that the Chinese firm was interested but they didn't inform the government until 2006, to the shock of the House of Commons' intelligence committee.
This means BT's 4G network is built using Huawei equipment – 5G will build on the existing 4G network. Because the British government kept delaying and ultimately took more than a year to make its decision on 5G, British telcos went ahead and began using Huawei equipment in lieu of a government directive.
Britain is allowing Huawei to supply 35 per cent of what it categorises as periphery infrastructure, such as masts and antennae.
What do 'core' and 'edge' mean?
Under 4G, the network consists of a central hub, often referred to as the ""core"", where the sorting and transfer (known as computing) of all the data we're consuming and sending happens. The radio towers and antennae you see on buildings are considered the ""edge"" of the network.
Because the data bit is centralised, the ""core"" is currently easier to protect from hackers and bad guys. But this changes under 5G because the highest-speed 5G will use radio spectra that don't reach very far. To address the problem of people losing connection as they move around and leave the reach of the transmitter or have their signal interrupted by obstacles, more antennae will be needed. Computing that once took place in the core will be pushed out into the wider network, meaning more data will be transmitted, making the network more vulnerable to disruptive actors.
This means more processing of your data – keeping in mind how many devices will be connected in the Internet of Things – has to take place outside the ""core"" and on what was considered the ""edge"" in 4G.
What is Britain's view?
Australian and US spy agencies have assessed that under 5G, there can be no difference between the core and the edge, meaning the entire network is considered ""critical infrastructure"" and must be protected accordingly.
But Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) thinks differently. Inside the NCSC sits the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), which was established to monitor the security risk posed by using Huawei equipment.
The HCSEC centre, known as The Cell, is funded by Huawei and its board includes Huawei HQ's deputy chair, Huawei's UK managing director, Huawei's UK communications director and Huawei's managing director.
The centre believes that, while more computing will be pushed out of the centralised hubs or core, that computing can still be protected.

Why do we care what Britain does?
Australia, Britain, the United States, New Zealand and Canada are part of an intelligence-sharing alliance called Five Eyes, established after World War II.
The US says it won't send intelligence over networks that could be compromised or hijacked by China. Washington and Canberra believe that through 5G, Huawei could easily build in access points known as ""back doors"" that would allow it to take control of 5G networks to either hack them, take them down or take over mobile-connected devices to perform hostile actions. Such secret back doors could be installed into the equipment over time, allowing Beijing to penetrate networks.
Malcolm Turnbull has said the greatest threat Australian agencies identified was not necessarily interception of intelligence, which can be sent through encrypted means, but denial of service.
In the worst-case scenario, the US and Australia believe the systems we rely on for the smooth functioning of society could be taken offline.
By contrast, Australia's Telstra does not have any Huawei in its network – it used Ericsson for its 4G rollout.
Vodafone and Optus used Huawei for their 4G. But Vodafone has signed with Nokia to supply its 5G and will phase out Huawei equipment in some parts of its network.
Optus says it is using ""other suppliers"" even though Huawei is ahead of the others ""from a pure technology perspective"".
What are the advantages of going with Huawei?
Defending his decision, Johnson said Huawei could deliver the super-fast broadband he had pledged to deliver because of its cost and rollout speed.
As well as leading in technology, Huawei is ahead on price – it is about 30 per cent cheaper than its rivals. Critics say massive Chinese state subsidies are allowing the company to undercut and kill rivals, leaving the world depending on Chinese equipment for its critical infrastructure.
What's next?
Europe and Canada are the main places to watch. Canada is the final member of the Five Eyes alliance to decide. Complicating things even further for Canada is that China has detained two Canadians since 2018 after Vancouver police arrested Ren's daughter and Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, on a US extradition warrant.

Germany is also poised to make its decision and, while not a member of the Five Eyes, is facing pressure to take a stance in line with US policy.

Facebook's divisive algorithms traced back to Francis Galton's 1800s eugenic theory

When we talk about Charles Darwin, it is rarely in the same breath that we discuss the modern-day internet algorithms which are dividing society with selective information.
Key points:
In the 1800s, eugenic theory — improving genetics through breeding — paved the way for big data analysis techniques
Social attitudes from the time, such as racism and sexism, still contribute to the biases of modern-day algorithms
An artificial intelligence expert believes a solution is building diversity into the criteria for algorithmic techniques
But according to the author of a book examining the roots of internet prejudice, it does indeed go back to the late 1800s and Darwin's era — namely his first cousin, Francis Galton.
""After Darwin wrote Origin of Species, Francis invented the idea of eugenics, believing the way to evolve to a better society was effectively to influence the breeding of human beings,"" said Robert Elliott Smith from University College London.
Among other achievements, Galton has been credited with inventing surveys to collect quantitative data on humans, and he was the first to apply statistical methods to study societal differences and intelligence lineage.
He endowed the University College London (UCL) with his archives and collections and, with a bequest, funded its first Chair of Eugenics.
""The department focused very much on the analysis of data on human beings — physiological data, schoolchildren's exams, and data around people — and from that data they developed a lot of statistical algorithms,"" Professor Smith said.
""Those statistical algorithms are, in fact, foundational to the way we deal with big data now.""

Algorithms predict your next move
Today's internet programs utilise algorithms that take note of every interaction a person makes online, including browsing habits, location, social media scrolling, search requests, and product purchases.
The programs then use that data to customise the information — and advertising — a person sees online so its suits their preferences and anticipates their interests.
They can also do the same for news and critical information, creating what is known as a filter bubble, a narrowed feed of current affairs that generally excludes viewpoints or topics a person doesn't habitually engage with — isolating some people intellectually to the point of being uninformed.

""There was a Pew Research Center study a number of years ago that found black people in America were much more likely to see news that's relevant to issues of racial discrimination than white people,"" Professor Smith said.
""White people effectively did not see that same news online, because big data-analysis algorithms basically said only black people cared about those topics.
""Effectively, we've now got information segregation.""
In Australia, information segregation can be witnessed on hot topics like immigration and the causes of climate change.
Rather than peer-reviewed information being disseminated online as a rule, people's news feeds — particularly those on social media platforms like Facebook — have become entangled with ideology and misinformation customised to what they want to hear, regardless of the facts.
An 1800s 'data cloud'
Professor Smith believes such algorithms utilise quantitative biases that were formed at UCL in the late 1800s.
Professors from its newly formed eugenics department took data from children's exam results and looked at it ""as a cloud"".
""They looked at its general shape and from that shape said, 'OK, there's one dominant axis in this cloud, and that axis seems to indicate that children who do better on some exams, tend to do better on all exams',"" Professor Smith said.
""They took big data, analysed it, and found something that proved the theory they already believed in, the idea that intelligence was inherently genetic.""
Social media is an outlet for increasingly narrow views of the world for many people. (ABC The Drum)
Internet algorithms in the present day, run by artificial intelligence, also form data clouds that are ""chopped up"" into groups to match generalised groups of people.
""These algorithms have inherent biases in them — the kind of questions they ask initially influences the results they get,"" Professor Smith said.
He said social attitudes from the 1800s had been built into those biases, including elements of racism and sexism that were commonplace during Darwin and Galton's era.
""Different cloud groups are being delivered different kinds of messages, both in terms of advertising, and ultimately, are being targeted for things like politics,"" Professor Smith said.
""But in my opinion, purely quantitative treatments of humans in society are always flawed and biased because human beings are, in fact, very complex.""
Building diversity into algorithms
Professor Smith has 30 years' experience working in artificial intelligence and talks about his findings and theories in his new book, Rage Inside the Machine: The Prejudice of Algorithms, and How to Stop the Internet Making Bigots of Us All.
He will also be presenting his theories during Planet Talks at the Womadelaide music, dance and art festival in Adelaide during March.
Professor Smith believes the solution is ensuring ""diversity"" is a basis for new AI algorithms because a ""canned solution"" to establishing their criteria does not work.
How to deal with online trolls
From telling their mum to helping them out, comedian Alice Fraser believes there are many ways to handle trolls.
""We need to look at social science outside the purely quantitative framework that's been looked at for the past 150 years, and to start seeing a more complex view of humans and their society,"" he said.
""Scientists are interested, people at the big tech firms are interested, but the big tech firms are ultimately driven by profit and they are legally mandated to be.""
Governments, he said, did not share the same appetite to address the problem.
""I see governments exploiting the problems with information delivery and creating more polarisation than trying to fix the problems,"" Professor Smith said.
Internet not to blame
There are, of course, opposing opinions about the cause of rising political polarisation.
This includes the University of Oxford's Grant Blank and University of Ottawa's Elizabeth Dubois whose joint paper published last year considered such theories to be ""overstated"".
They said only a small proportion of society was caught inside filter bubbles, or ""echo chambers"", and tended to be ""politically uninterested"".
From their own quantitative study, involving 148 respondents, the two professors said this segment of the population was small — about 8 per cent— and generally had little influence on society.
Those who were politically engaged, they argued, were more likely to search multiple sources of information and were subsequently more likely to come across views alternative to their own.
Their research was funded by Google, the world's biggest search engine. It is one of the first papers an online search on the topic delivers.
Covert activities worse than ads
Professor Smith pointed to non-profit verification network First Draft, which recently claimed nearly 90 per cent of Conservative Facebook ads that appeared during the last week of election campaigning in the UK were misleading.
It said the Conservatives spent more than 50,000 pounds for nearly 7,000 Facebook ads between November 27 and December 3 in a blitz that took advantage of the social media giant's controversial attitude to factual content.
Professor Smith said paid political ads were not the worst of it.
""The worst of it is the covert activity that goes on through fake accounts and manipulations that are very difficult to detect,"" he said.
""That's going to require real policing and regulation to stop.""
Despite the challenges, Professor Smith was hopeful the tide would turn.
""I think the world will ultimately evolve to a better place,"" he said.
""The question is, do we have to go through Mad Max before we get to a better place?""

十天建成的武汉火神山医院正式接诊感染新冠病毒患者。

今天，备受关注的武汉火神山医院正式开始收治患者。
据新华社报道，火神山医院从设计到竣工共用10天，于昨日（2月2日）正式交付解放军使用。
交付军队后，1400名解放军医护人员将从2月3日起在这里救治感染新型冠状病毒的患者。
中国媒体报道说，火神山医院的设计借鉴了非典时期的北京小汤山医院的设计方案，面积超过3万平方米，拥有419间病房，1000张病床，配备有CT扫描设备和重症监护病房。

为防止气流产生交叉感染，多数病房均为负压房间。负压病房内单独设置了排风系统，确保病房内的压力低于外界，这样室内的污染空气就不会排出。
火神山医院交付使用后，中国媒体纷纷赞誉说，这是一所用“火神”速度建造的医院，堪称“奇迹”。
除火神山医院外，武汉还有另一所用于治疗新型冠状病毒感染患者的医院——雷神山医院，也在紧张施工中。
据武汉媒体报道，雷神山医院是一所可收治更多病人的医院，总建筑建筑面积为7.5万平方米，将拥有1500张病床，预计2月5日交付使用，次日收治病人。
医院名字与地域无关

武汉并没有火神山和雷神山这两座山，为什么抗击新冠病毒的两所医院要以此命名呢？
中国媒体环球网刊载文章称，在楚文化中，楚国人认为自己是黄帝子孙，火神祝融的后代。
人的肺部五行属金，火克金。由于新型冠状病毒害怕高温，火神正好能驱瘟神，所以用“火神山”这个名字。
华东师范大学的民俗专家田兆元教授认为，“雷神山”这个名字也不是随便起的，因为火和雷在八卦里相生，都是克制邪恶的力量。而根据五行之说，雷神山和火神山相辅相成。

Coronavirus: How hackers are preying on fears of Covid-19
13 March 2020
Share
Save
Joe TidyCyber-security reporter

Security experts say a spike in email scams linked to coronavirus is the worst they have seen in years.
Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance.
Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found.
The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns.
1. Click here for a cure
Proofpoint
Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen
Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments.
The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time.
""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team.
Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day.
""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo.
The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click.
2. Covid-19 tax refund
Mimecast
HM Revenue and Customs is not trying to give you a Covid-19 tax rebate
Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours.
If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information.
""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund.""
3. Little measure that saves
Proofpoint
The World Health Organization is being impersonated by many hacking campaigns
Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread.
""This little measure can save you,"" they claim.
But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger.
This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online.
To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice.
4. The virus is now airborne
Cofense
Hackers are using fear-mongering tactics to encourge clicks and downloads
The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission.
It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool.
Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"".
It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic. Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account.
Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap.
One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account.
5. Donate here to help the fight
Kaspersky
The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin
This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing.
Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware.
""We expect the numbers to grow, of course, as the real virus continues to spread,"" says David Emm, principal security researcher at the firm.

Brisbane woman charged over alleged dark web purchases
By Staff Writers
Apr 16 2018 12:01PM

Joint federal investigation.
A 32-year-old Brisbane woman has been accused of buying drugs from a “dark web” portal.
The woman was arrested and charged after shipments were intercepted by the Australian Border Force and an investigation by the Australian Federal Police.
Police alleged “the woman used a dark web portal and cryptocurrency Bitcoin to order, pay and organise multiple shipments of illicit drugs from United Kingdom”.
Border Force’s regional commander for Queensland, Terry Price, said in a statement that “people shouldn’t assume the dark web is invisible to Australian agencies”.
“Through close collaboration with our law enforcement partners we are able to detect imports purchased through these sites,” Price said.
Border Force said last year that it had deployed officers to specifically focus on drug purchases being made using dark web sites.
The AFP also last year claimed to have received some data intercepted by authorities who shut down the Hansa market, one of two such markets closed last year.

Sizzler Rockhampton will close on March 1.

Yet another much loved Sizzler restaurant is set to serve its last piece of cheese toast after it was revealed the Rockhampton branch was set to close on March 2.
The eatery is located within the Stockland Shopping Centre and is being shut down due to redevelopment plans for the mall.
However, parent company Collins Foods Limited has confirmed it will not reopen once the renovations are completed.
“Collins Foods Limited has confirmed it will close its Rockhampton Sizzler restaurant with the closure coinciding with the redevelopment of the Stockland shopping centre,” a spokesman told news.com.au.
“Sizzler Rockhampton will trade as usual until its last day, Sunday March 1, 2020.
“The announcement relates to Sizzler Rockhampton only and all other Sizzler restaurants remain open for business.”
The spokesman said Collins was working with the affected managers and team members at Sizzler Rockhampton – believed to number around 61 – regarding “possible employment opportunities at other Collins foods restaurants, and outplacement support as needed”.
“We want to thank our employees for their dedication, and our guests for their loyalty, over the last 31 years,” the spokesman said.
“The staff and management of Sizzler Rockhampton have been fantastic, making sure every dining experience was a great one for our amazing customers.”
According to documents dicovered by The Morning Bulletin, the Rockhampton Sizzler building is set to be demolished, with an application approved by Rockhampton Regional Council last week.
After the Rockhampton outlet closes, just nine Sizzler restaurants will remain in Australia, including Caboolture, Loganholme, Maroochydore, Mermaid Beach and Toowoomba in Queensland, Campbelltown in NSW and Innaloo, Kelmscott and Morley in Western Australia.
Sizzler Rockhampton is just the latest Aussie outlet to close.
But it seems locals aren’t giving up without a fight.
Local woman Rachel Titmarsh launched a Chang.org petition to save the Rockhampton Sizzler, and after just one week it has attracted 1255 signatures.
“As many of us Rockhampton people have found out today, after 31 years trading here, Sizzler will no longer be in Rockhampton from the 2nd of March,” Ms Titmarsh wrote.
“Stockland Rockhampton have decided they’re ‘redeveloping’ (not that they really need to with all the empty shops that are already there) and Sizzler is OUT.
“This is a desperate plea to Collins Foods Limited, PLEASE don’t leave Rockhampton, please open somewhere else if Stockland are kicking you out.”
It has received an outpouring of passionate pleas from other Sizzler aficionados, with one woman writing: “I love Sizzler and I firmly believe that closing the restaurant is detrimental to the workers and Rockhampton region. Sizzler is a local icon as is their Cheese toast and Malibu chicken.”
“As a family we have always gone to sizzler for special occasions,” another local posted, while another said: “It is the only reason we visit Rockhampton. Been going to Sizzler for years. The only place that caters for everyone’s taste.”
A Change.org petition to keep a Sizzler in Rockhampton is gaining momentum. Picture: Change.org
The latest closure comes after a string of other shutdowns in recent years.
In July 2017 a Sizzler outlet in Annerley in Brisbane’s south also closed, with restaurants in Brookside, Toowong and Kogarah all closing that same year.
The company told news.com.au at the time that while it had closed a “small number” of stores in 2017 as leases ran out, “each closure was based on an independent assessment of that restaurant’s performance and the ongoing suitability of the location.”
SIZZLER’S STORY
The first ever Sizzler restaurant was opened in California in 1958 by restaurateurs Del and Helen Johnson, who had read an article about a radical new “self service budget steakhouse” restaurant model.
At the time the menu contained just steak, salad and dinner rolls but later expanded into hamburgers by the early 1960s, when the restaurant grew into a Los Angeles chain.
In the 1970s the concept evolved and the company continued to expand, and it launched in Australia in 1984, with Sizzler owner and Australian listed company Collins Foods International converting Bonanza and Taco Den restaurants into Sizzlers.
It soon became an Aussie family favourite, and went on to expand into the Asian market with branches now found in the US, Australia, Thailand, Japan and China.

London: China's most senior diplomat in the UK has admonished Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saying the cap on Huawei involvement in the 5G network is not a good representation of the country's claim to be a free-market economy.
Ambassador Liu Xiaoming told British television that the string of ex-cabinet ministers seeking an Australian-style ban on the Chinese technology provider was a ""witch-hunt"".
""They are totally wrong, I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt,"" Liu told the BBC'sAndrew Marr Show.

But Liu said while the Chinese government was pleased with Britain's decision, it was not ""100 per cent satisfied"" because the 35 per cent cap ""does not show your principle of a free economy, free competition"".
Under Chinese law, the authoritarian government in Beijing can order Huawei to conduct espionage on its behalf.
Australia and the US have subsequently banned the Chinese vendor from supplying to the 5G rollout. But Johnson broke ranks with his allies to allow Chinese involvement but said Huawei was a ""high-risk"" supplier and could supply no more than 35 per cent of the overall network.
The decision has angered US President Donald Trump as well as Australia and has sparked a rebellion by Tory MPs, led by a string of ex-cabinet ministers.
Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith cited an article by the Australian Signals Directorate's Simeon Gilding, saying it made no sense to say Huawei was ""high-risk"" but still allow it to build the nation's critical infrastructure.
""The best course for the government, given that it has inherited the existing involvement of Huawei, is to plan to clear the firm out of our systems as quickly as possible,"" Duncan Smith wrote in the London Telegraph.
""Defence of the realm is the government's number one priority, and this includes cyberspace.""
""There can be no room in our systems for companies such as Huawei.""
Duncan Smith also took aim at China's criticism saying it was ""impossible"" for a Western company to bid for access to build China's infrastructure in the same way Huawei does abroad.
""Huawei effectively receives support from the Chinese state, which means that it can undercut any commercial fair price offered by a Western telco,"" he said.
""That puts permanent pressure on Samsung, Fujitsu, Nokia and Ericsson and feeds dependence on Chinese services.""
Britain's split with the Five Eyes intelligence club, comprising the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada is seen as a major victory for Huawei as European nations consider whether to allow the Chinese vendor into their networks.
In Paris, the Chinese embassy threatened rivals Nokia and Ericsson over the French government's decision to exclude Huawei from its rollout.
""China has always given Nokia and Ericsson fair treatment in the deployment of 5G networks in China and has even allowed them to take part in the deployment of the core networks,"" the embassy said in a statementonline.
""We do not wish to see the development of European companies in the Chinese market affected by the discrimination and protectionism of France and other European countries with regard to Huawei.""

London: China's most senior diplomat in the UK has admonished Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saying the cap on Huawei involvement in the 5G network is not a good representation of the country's claim to be a free-market economy.
Ambassador Liu Xiaoming told British television that the string of ex-cabinet ministers seeking an Australian-style ban on the Chinese technology provider was a ""witch-hunt"".
""They are totally wrong, I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt,"" Liu told the BBC'sAndrew Marr Show.

British MPs call for Australian-style Huawei ban for NATO, Five Eyes countries

London: Tory MPs pressuring Boris Johnson over Huawei involvement want all NATO and Five Eyes countries to sign up to an Australian-style Huaweiban.
The British Prime Minister is facing a serious rebellion among his own MPs over his decision to approve Huawei involvement in the 5G rollout, a decision that has angered allies including Australia and the US.

The six MPs, including former cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Damian Green, Owen Paterson and Tobias Ellwood, as well as backbencher Bob Seely, have been dubbed by British media as ""The Wolverines"" - the same name used by a group of Australian MPs who take a hawkish line on China.
Their intervention follows The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age's revelation that a veteran member of the Australian Parliament's intelligence committee privately confronted British foreign secretary Dominic Raab over the British decision last month to approve Huawei to supply the 5G rollout, against the urging of Australia and the US.
US President Donald Trump reportedly slammed the phone down on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson after Huawei was granted access to the UK's 5G network.

American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the US will not send intelligence it gathers through a network it doesn't trust, meaning British access to the elite Five Eyes spying club, which comprises Australia, Britain, US, New Zealand and Canada, could be jeopardised.
President Donald Trump was reported to be ""apoplectic"" and slammed the phone down on Johnson.
In Canberra, Labor MP Anthony Byrne told Raab the decision was tantamount to letting Russia build their infrastructure and was based on incorrect advice from Britain's spy agencies.
The group of Tory MPs seized on the reaction from Britain's Five Eyes allies on Saturday in a letter to be sent to their colleagues when the Commons sits on Monday.
They said Huawei had entered Britain ""by stealth"" in the 2000s making its role in the 5G networks ""a fait accompli, aided by an extensive lobbying operation"". Huawei signed a deal with BT without telling the government, meaning it has a significant presence in the existing 4G network.
The MPs said Western democracies should only use trusted vendors which would be companies ""from countries that have fair market competition, rule of law, respect human rights, data privacy and non-coercive Government agencies"".
""We believe that democratic states, particularly Five Eyes and NATO nations should work together in pursuit of security, to agree to common rules for our Critical National Infrastructure and in particular a ""trusted vendor"" stats for firms working on 5G,"" the MPs said.
Crucially, the MPs urged colleagues to read an article written by Simeon Gilding, a former director of ASD, the Australian equivalent of Britain's GCHQ.
In that article for the Australian Strategic and Policy Institute, Gilding said GCHQ's assessment that it could involve China's Huawei and maintain security was wrong.
Under Chinese law, Beijing can order Huawei to spy on its behalf. Gilding said if this instruction was given there was no scenario in which the network could be protected under the extensive modelling ASD carried out.
This advice informed then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's thinking before the Coalition banned Huawei from the 5G rollout in 2018.
Australia was the first to ban Huawei from its 5G network, following on from the then Labor government's decision to exclude the Chinese firm from the National Broadband Network in 2012.
The US is hardening it's public criticism of the British decision.
Asked in a CNBC interview if Britain's use of China's Huawei was a possible deal breaker in future trade negotiations with the United States, Vice-President Mike Pence said ""we'll see"".

'Antithetical to our Liberal principles': MPs move to prevent $10,000 cash ban

A political backlash is threatening to halt a Morrison government plan to outlaw cash payments over $10,000 in a fight over the cost for consumers and companies of forcing a shift to electronic transactions.
Ministers are facing a torrent of criticism from Liberal and Nationals MPs as well as party members who believe the crackdown on cash is a breach of the government's stated belief in the free market.
Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar has privately criticised the plan to his Liberal colleagues out of frustration that he inherited the proposal from the last term of Parliament.

The divisions set up a clash in the Senate that could veto the bill unless the government acts on demands from its own MPs to abandon the reform or send it back to department officials for extensive changes.
""In my view, there is a sense among party members and I think Liberal voters, that on this bill the party is not staying true to its Liberal values,"" Victorian Liberal member Steve Holland said. ""I'd like to see the legislation withdrawn because in my view it is antithetical to our Liberal principles.""
Mr Holland, a web developer, secured a vote from hundreds of Liberal members opposing the reform at the party's Victorian state council, triggering a letter to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to respond to the concerns by February 17.
The minister in charge of the bill, Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar, has privately criticised the plan to his Liberal colleagues out of frustration that he inherited the proposal from the last term of Parliament.
""I know there is deep disquiet across the government on the merits of this bill,"" one Liberal MP who declined to be named said on Friday. ""There's just no enthusiasm for it at all.""
While the Australian Tax Office wants to stamp out the ""black economy"" by curbing large cash payments, critics said the cost would be far greater than the benefits if Australians were banned from using more than $10,000 in cash.
Those speaking up against the bill include the Housing Industry Association, NSW Farmers, the Australian Dental Association and big retail groups that say customers like to save cash to make big payments.
""It is unclear what evidence exists to illustrate that limiting cash transactions to $10,000 will prevent tax avoidance and illegal activities,"" NSW Farmers told the Treasurer last year.
There is a sense among party members and I think Liberal voters, that on this bill the party is not staying true to its Liberal values.
Victorian Liberal member Steve Holland
Flight Centre backed the changes in principle but said some of its customers liked to pay for holidays with cash after putting money away for months or years.
""Our ability to track [transactions] to meet the requirements of this regulation is a concern for us,"" Flight Centre risk manager Brett Anderson told a Senate inquiry on January 30.
Treasury official Patrick Boneham told the Senate hearing of cases including a bikie gang that used $1.5 million in cash to buy 10 luxury cars so they could be sold to launder the money.
Economist John Adams, a former government official and adviser to Liberal ministers on deregulation, said the policy was at odds with the government's own rhetoric.
""This policy is completely inconsistent with the thinking about how to deregulate an economy and promote not only economic freedom but robust economic outcomes,"" Mr Adams told the Senate hearing.
Coalition MPs including Russell Broadbent, Barnaby Joyce, George Christensen and Patrick Conaghan spoke against the bill in a party room meeting last September.
The concerns have grown in recent months and the government is playing for time to reconsider the plan, moving on Thursday night in the Senate to postpone a report on the bill until February 28.
Labor senators Kimberley Kitching and Jenny McAllister have challenged Treasury over the change, given there is no formal regulation impact statement to quantify the costs and benefits. Labor voted for the bill in the lower house but is yet to decide its final position after the Senate review, raising the prospect of a defeat for the government if it proceeds.
Centre Alliance Senator Rex Patrick said the benefits of the cash ban were not clear but the problems were, including the likelihood that criminals would get around the restrictions while law-abiding Australians were inconvenienced.
""The balance lies against supporting the bill,"" Senator Patrick said.

CBD Melbourne: Another McCormack takes the lead

The departure of Bridget McKenzie from Cabinet has raised serious questions about Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack’s hold on the National Party’s leadership.
Only hours after her resignation, and with a party room meeting today, Barnaby Joyce had already signalled his intention to challenge McCormack if given the opportunity.
But another McCormack has had a quiet leadership win. The DPM’s wife Catherine McCormack has been appointed convener of the Parliamentary Partners Association.
That’s the social caucus of parliamentary husbands, wives and partners presided over – until late last year – by Teresa Ramsay and Robyn Coulton (the spouses of Government Whip Rowan Ramsay and Regional Services Minister Mark Coulton respectively).
Power couple: Michael and Catherine McCormack.

A missive sent by Catherine McCormack last Friday informed PPA members of the leadership change. And while the PPA has traditionally been dominated by the partners of Coalition MPs, this year’s assistant convener is Liesl Centenera. She’s the partner of recently elected Canberra Labor MP David Smith.
The association’s new leadership also includes Judi van Manen (married to Chief Government Whip Bert van Manen) and Charlotte Gillespie (whose husband David Gillespie is in the race to replace McKenzie as the Nationals’ deputy leader).

HARPOON SEASON
Has Labor found a wealthy hedge fund donor prepared to fork out a motza as it waits out its time on the Opposition benches before the next election?
Among the corporate heavies and deep-pocketed business types who had dug deep in the last year – largely for the Liberal Party – was one name long-associated with the secretive investment fund Rockhampton Management: Eric Forday.
Disclosures for the last financial year made to the Australian Electoral Commission, and released yesterday, show an Eric Forday dropping $100,000 to Labor immediately before the May federal election. The address on the disclosure is a Rockhampton suburb.
Forday, a former analyst at investment bank SBC Warburg, now lives in Japan and Rockhampton manages more than $2 billion. Our attempts to contact him failed.
The disclosures also turned up $26,000 in donations to the Liberals from struggling cinema and theme park operator Village Roadshow (and $6000 to Labor), significantly lower than the $163,000 doled out the previous year. To make up the shortfall, deposed chief executive Graham Burke handed over $45,000 to the Libs instead.
Ros Packer, John Gandel and Marcus Blackmore were all generous to Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s re-election efforts, while Anthony Pratt split his $3 million splurge more evenly.
Pacific Blue Capital, the private equity outfit run by Morrison’s close friend Scott Briggs, donated more than $80,000 to the Liberals while Melbourne University chancellor Allan Myers stumped up more than $50,000.
Myers, more than most donors, knows plenty about the inner workings of the party. After all, he represented the party’s wealthy fundraising arm, the Cormack Foundation, in its long-running legal stoush with the party over who ultimately controlled the foundation’s funds.
POLLIES, JUST LIKE US
Spotted at Kingston Italian joint Molto on Sunday, ahead of the return of Parliament in Canberra today: Labor’s energy spokesman Mark Butler and NSW MP Pat Conroy.
Witnesses told CBD Butler appeared unimpressed by the wine (corked). Back it went.
PUT OUT MORE FLAGS
Victorian Liberal officials caved to members demanding a party-wide meeting to discuss preselections with an offer to hold a special state council in early March.
For the members demanding the special state council, the backdown last Friday might be a case of winning the battle but losing the war. They are proposing a vote of no confidence and a spill of the state’s administrative committee, largely as a result of its refusal to delay preselections.
But as readers might remember, their efforts so far have amounted to nought.
After all, preselections for sitting MPs kicked off last month. In other words, that ship has sailed.
It appears that the agitators’ efforts to turf the state’s officials with a spill motion won’t get anywhere either. President Robert Clark told members that the special state council would vote on the no confidence motion, but the spill motion had been thrown out by the party’s constitutional committee.
No wonder Andrew Asten and others who proposed the motion are now considering pulling the pin on the whole ordeal. In any case, members will get to have their say on committee members at an annual general meeting in May.
TIGER COUNTRY
But there are other internal squabbles for Victorian Liberals to contend with.
The state’s disputes panel is currently considering a complaint against upper house veteran Bernie Finn. He is accused of bullying and intimidating a member at a recent branch meeting held inside Senator Scott Ryan’s office in Moonee Ponds.
In a complaint filed to party officials and seen by CBD, long-time member Diane Plim alleges Mr Finn “responded angrily and loudly, ‘Shut up you silly old woman!’ (repeatedly), followed by ‘Why don’t you stick your head up the bum of a bear?’”
Plim says she found the comments to be most “most unparliamentary, bullying and intimidating … misogynistic in the extreme.”
State director Sam McQuestin said party rules precluded him from making any comment on the investigation but said the disputes panel takes all complaints seriously.
Ms Plim did not respond to requests for comment.

People who have visited or transited through mainland China from Saturday will be banned from entering Australia for two weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to nearly 12,000 globally.
Australian citizens, permanent residents and members of their immediate families will be exempt from the ban but will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days from their date of departure from China, Mr Morrison said on Saturday.

Australians who are currently in Wuhan and have asked to be evacuated by the Australian government have been told that a Qantas flight will leave the city on February 3, and that Australian permanent residents as well as citizens will be allowed to board.
However, anyone with a temperature of 37.3 degrees celsius or above will not be allowed onto the aircraft and will be asked to seek medical assistance within Wuhan, those shortlisted for the flight have been told by the Australian government in an email.
Mr Morrison said the decision to implement the travel ban was made ""to substantially reduce the volume of travellers coming from mainland China"" after a meeting of the Chief Medical Officers of all states and territories on Saturday.
Mr Morrison said the meeting noted the ""increasing but still relatively small number of cases in provinces outside the Hubei province and the now resulting risk posed from travellers from all of mainland China"".

There have been 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia so far, including a fourth case in Victoria and two new cases in South Australia on Saturday.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also changed its travel advice for China to ""do not travel"".
Mr Morrison said the Border Force commissioner would be given the discretion to allow entry to people on flights arriving on Sunday morning.
""They consider that the immediate threat is low but we need to get these arrangements in place as soon as possible,"" Mr Morrison said.
""Within 24 hours our advice is that they'll be able to step up those processes throughout the international channels far more effectively.""
Mr Morrison said that 500,000 masks and thermometers will be provided to airports.
Qantas has announced that it will suspend its flights from mainland China from February 9 until March 29.
The US has announced that it will ban non-US citizens who have recently travelled to China from entering the country from Sunday.
The World Health Organisation currently does not recommend limiting trade and movement, with its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that ""travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering [information] sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies"".
However, Mr Morrison said ""our medical advice was that it was in the interests of Australians"" to implement restrictions on travel.
Mr Morrison also denied that the decision to transfer people being evacuated from Wuhan to Christmas Island for two weeks was controversial.
""I think...[Australians] also want to be assured that the quarantine arrangements, when we are taking people from the most-affected part of China - which is where this virus began and where the human-to-human contact has been the most prolific - that we are taking the most serious precautions in putting the quarantine arrangements in place,"" Mr Morrison said.
Mr Morrison said he has also told Education Minister Dan Tehan to work with universities to minimise disruption to international students, about 211,000 of whom are from China.
""That can mean the delaying of the commencement of courses, the providing of courses online in the initial phases, the delaying of orientation weeks,"" Mr Morrison said.
Catriona Jackson, chief executive of the sector's peak body Universities Australia, said universities will look to offer online study and deferred start date options to affected students.

Cyberattack on BlueScope Steel Derails Australia Operations
By CISOMAG - May 18, 2020
B
lueScope, an Australian steel products manufacturer, reported a cyber incident that affected its manufacturing and sales operations in Australia. The type or source of the cyberattack is still unknown, but as per the company’s official statement, operations only in Australia were affected.
The cyber incident in BlueScope Steel was detected in one of the company’s U.S. businesses and the team had acted promptly to respond to this incident.
BlueScope Steel is one of the oldest steel product manufacturers in Australia and has partnerships with the Asian heavyweights of this industry like the Tata conglomerate and Nippon Steel. Their customer base and operations pan across the Pacific Rim from Asia, Australia, New Zealand, right to the west coast of North America. Thus, the cyberattack of any magnitude could have easily derailed its global operations.
The company’s Chief Financial Officer, Tania Archibald, said, “The cyber incident in BlueScope Steel was detected in one of the company’s U.S. businesses and our team had acted promptly to respond to the incident. In the affected areas the company has reverted to manual operations wherever possible, while it fully assesses the impact and remediates as required, to return to normal operations at the earliest.” Archibald also confirmed that BlueScope’s North Star, Asian, and New Zealand businesses continued as normal with minor disruptions and latencies due to the impact from Australian operations.
Australia’s Toll Group Affected by Mailto Ransomware
Earlier in February 2020, Australia’s logistics giant, Toll Group, was targeted by a cybersecurity incident that compromised around 1,000 systems affecting local and global deliveries across the country. As per the findings of the experts from the Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC), the logistics company’s computer and network infrastructure were hit by the Mailto ransomware attack.
The report of Toll Group being affected by ransomware first surfaced when the company issued a press release on itswebsiteandTwitterhandle, officially informing its users about the incident. Post the attack discovery, Toll promptly shut down several systems across multiple sites and business units in Australia to contain the spread of the cyberattack. However, it continued to function its regular pickup, process, and dispatch services but at a slow pace due to manual processing of local and international parcels across Australia.

A company official has assured Consumer Protection that the personal data of clients has not been compromised and, after a brief system outage, the company is now operating in a business as usual fashion.
The ransomware attack which occurred on 14 February 2020 is similar to the one that affected Toll Group two weeks earlier, disrupting freight and parcel deliveries. WA ScamNet has received 68 reports of ransomware or malware attacks since 1 January 2019.
Commissioner for Consumer Protection Penny Lipscombe said businesses should be on alert about these cyber-attacks and have effective security measures in place.
“Often the ransomware is downloaded by an employee who opens an attachment in a scam email or clicks on a link, giving the cyber criminals access to the computer system,” Ms Lipscombe said.
“The system is locked by the criminals and files encrypted, followed by a ransom demand to have the system unlocked. Of course, we recommend that companies do not pay the ransom as the criminals are likely to come back asking for more money.
“Paying will also give the criminals added incentive to continue their illegal and highly disruptive practices. Instead, seek expert IT assistance to have the computer system restored.”
“All businesses should have their cyber security reviewed and updated so that they have the latest anti-virus software and firewalls installed to be protected from malware. Staff also need to be trained not to automatically open attachments or click on links in emails, especially if the sender is unknown. Even when senders are known, staff should be vigilant as accounts may have been hacked.
“Money spent on cyber security is money well spent, especially when compared to the cost of having computer systems locked and, in extreme cases, businesses not being able to operate for a considerable amount of time.”
Take measures to prevent ransomware:
Do not open attachments that could be infected, especially from unknown senders.
If in doubt about an attachment do not open it, even if it is from someone you know. Their computer or email account could have been hacked.
Make sure you have up-to-date anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software and scan your computer regularly.
Keep a backup copy of your data in a safe place, disconnected from your computer and the internet.

Cyberattackers have hit Australian healthcare providers over the past week, exposing deep vulnerabilities in an industry that the government is trying to help through investments in cybersecurity and information sharing.

Leading Australian IVF and fertility services provider Genea said Wednesday that hackers infiltrated its patient management system, BabySentry, earlier in February and stole detailed personal and healthcare information of patients, including their contact details, medical records, health insurance details, medications, prescriptions and diagnostic tests.
The compromised records also included patients' medical histories, Medicare card numbers, emergency contacts of next of kin and health questionnaires. Genea said it reported the incident to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Australian Cyber Security Center while its IT team handled extensive remediation efforts.
The Termite ransomware group, an offshoot of the Babuk group, claimed responsibility for stealing about 700 GB of patient records from Genea's systems. The IVF company said an attacker first accessed its Citrix environment on Jan. 31 and on Feb. 14, exfiltrated 940.7 GB from its IT systems to a remote DigitalOcean cloud server the hackers controlled. The list of affected systems included Genea's primary file server, patient management system and backup server.
And in the past week, the Anubis ransomware group published patients' names, medical histories, contact details and Medicare data stolen from Victoria-based Pound Road Medical Center. The Riverina Medical and Dental Aboriginal Corporation, a healthcare institution for aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders, also said it had experienced a cyber incident that may have compromised patients' personal information.
Both breaches happened on the heels of an announcement by the Australian government to invest AU$6.4 million, or $4.3 million, to set up a cybersecurity information-sharing network for government and private hospitals and health clinics to raise the sector's preparedness against rising cyberattacks (see: Australia Funds Healthcare Cyber Information-Sharing Network).
The Critical Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or CI-ISAC, which will set up the new program, said the Health Cyber Sharing Network will provide 750 government hospitals, 650 private hospitals and about 6,500 general practitioner clinics with real-time information on emerging cyberthreats.
The proposal followed major cyberattacks on Australia's healthcare sector, including a ransomware attack on private health insurer Medibank in 2022 that compromised the personal and sensitive health information of up to 9.7 million current and former customers. Medibank later pledged to spend AU$126 million, or $84.78 million, over three years to upgrade its IT security practices (see: Medibank to Spend AU$126M on Post-Breach Security Upgrade).
Australia's largest nonprofit healthcare provider, St Vincent's Health Australia, suffered a cyberattack in December 2023 that affected more than a dozen public and private hospitals and elderly care facilities.
A ransomware attack on e-prescription firm MediSecure in 2024 compromised the personal and healthcare information of approximately 12.9 million individuals. Threat actors gained access to the information, totaling 6.5 terabytes of data, by stealing electronic prescriptions dating between March 2019 and November 2023. The cyber incident forced the company into liquidation.
Australia's largest cybersecurity company, CyberCX, said in a report that healthcare was the most targeted sector in 2024, accounting for 17% of all incidents. Healthcare also faced more business email compromise and cyber extortion attempts than the financial and government sectors - which are usually at the top of the list.
In the aftermath of the Medibank cyber incident, the Australian Digital Health Agency introduced mandatory security requirements for clinical information systems used by hospitals, general practices and pharmacies. The proposal aimed at securing clinical software products connected to the My Health Record system from cyberattacks and preventing the leakage of citizens' healthcare information.
According to cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf, the Australian healthcare sector suffers from a critical lack of investment in digital infrastructure, low-level cyber literacy among practitioners, a lack of training, limited multi-agency collaboration on cybersecurity and the high cost of modern cybersecurity implementations.
""This all adds up to abundant vulnerabilities and poorly protected points of entry for cybercriminals to exploit.

Clearview AI, the Aussie-founded startup at the centre of a
data privacy debate
for its facial recognition software, has suffered a data breach reportedly exposing its entire customer list, and details about those customers.
A notification sent to Clearview customers said an intruder had “gained unauthorized access” to the startup’s entire customer list,
The Daily Beast
reports
.
The memo said the intruder was able to see how many searches those customers have made, and how many accounts they have set up.
It’s not clear what the intruder intends to use this data for, but the startup also said its servers were not breached, and that there was no access to law enforcement agencies’ search histories.
Founded by US-based Australian entrepreneur Hoan Ton-That, Clearview rose to notoriety in January this year, when
The New York Times
suggested
it’s tech is already in use
at more than 600 law enforcement agencies in the US.

Clearview uses an AI algorithm allowing users to snap a photo of anyone in public, upload it, and access any public images of that person — for example on their public social media accounts.
It has been reported that it has amassed about three billion images of people.
The app was quickly denounced as “disturbing and unethical”, with many social media users raising significant concerns about safety.
“This app isn’t available to the public yet, but Clearview thinks it will be in the near future.”
Please think very carefully about the lives you would be putting in danger if this app were to become available to the public. This is a disturbing and unethical use of technology.
https://t.co/gSMQSoVLys
— Becca Fouts (@BeccaFouts)
January 20, 2020
Soon, Twitter became the
first social media platform
to officially demand Clearview stops using images and data from its site. It also requested that Clearview deleted any data it had already acquired.
A
CNET
report suggested
that while the app is not currently available to the general public, it could be “in the future”.
Clearview, however, maintains it is not a consumer application, and that the technology is only available for law enforcement agencies.
At the same time, a report from
The New York Times
’
The Daily
podcast suggested the startup can
stop people from being identified
, suggesting it can control the results of police investigations.

Clearview AI, the Aussie-founded startup at the centre of a data privacy debate for its facial recognition software, has suffered a data breach reportedly exposing its entire customer list, and details about those customers.
A notification sent to Clearview customers said an intruder had “gained unauthorized access” to the startup’s entire customer list, The Daily Beast reports.
The memo said the intruder was able to see how many searches those customers have made, and how many accounts they have set up.
It’s not clear what the intruder intends to use this data for, but the startup also said its servers were not breached, and that there was no access to law enforcement agencies’ search histories.
Founded by US-based Australian entrepreneur Hoan Ton-That, Clearview rose to notoriety in January this year, when The New York Times suggested it’s tech is already in use at more than 600 law enforcement agencies in the US.

Clearview uses an AI algorithm allowing users to snap a photo of anyone in public, upload it, and access any public images of that person— for example on their public social media accounts.
It has been reported that it has amassed about three billion images of people.
The app was quickly denounced as “disturbing and unethical”, with many social media users raising significant concerns about safety.
“This app isn’t available to the public yet, but Clearview thinks it will be in the near future.”
Please think very carefully about the lives you would be putting in danger if this app were to become available to the public. This is a disturbing and unethical use of technology. https://t.co/gSMQSoVLys
— Becca Fouts (@BeccaFouts) January 20, 2020
Soon, Twitter became the first social media platform to officially demand Clearview stops using images and data from its site. It also requested that Clearview deleted any data it had already acquired.
A CNET report suggested that while the app is not currently available to the general public, it could be “in the future”.
Clearview, however, maintains it is not a consumer application, and that the technology is only available for law enforcement agencies.
At the same time, a report from The New York Times’ The Daily podcast suggested the startup can stop people from being identified, suggesting it can control the results of police investigations.

Australian wool sales stopped by ransomware attack

Feb 27 2020 1:15PM
Software maker Talman hit by attackers.
Wool sales across Australia have been halted after Talman, a major software supplier to the industry, was hit by a ransomware attack that encrypted its production databases.
Talman Group’s CEO Dr Pramod Pandey confirmed the attack to
iTnews
and said he was in regular contact with the Australian wool industry on the company’s recovery efforts.
On its website, the company says “more than 75 percent of the wool industry in Australia and New Zealand uses” its software for “public and private auctions, private sales, delivery, dumping and local or overseas processing”.
Wool sales across Australia have
had to be rescheduled
while the critical software remains offline.
Live numbers from the
Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX)
shows no wool bales being sold.
Wool industry executives reached by
iTnews
could not immediately comment as they met on what to do about planned sales and auctions. Industry publication
Sheep Central
said
a decision was due at 2pm today.
Dr Pandey said Talman is in the process of standing up its systems on entirely new infrastructure.
“We had the attack and we are bringing the service online, so it's all under control now,” he said.
“[The attackers] encrypted certain database files, so that makes the whole system inoperative.
“Instead of trying to reinstate our backup [on the existing infrastructure] … we started resurrecting it [on] new infrastructure.
“In other words we moved it to a different data centre altogether for the time being, before we get into the investigation of what actually happened.”
Dr Pandey said the company had not wanted to take a further risk by cleansing its existing hardware.
“It’s critical software for the industry, and at this stage, cost has not been the consideration,” he said.
The company had not notified the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) or other authorities of the attack, with Dr Pandey saying he would leave that to Talman’s insurers.
“We [will] hand this over to our insurer, and they [will] take care of this part of it,” he said.
“Our insurer has got better resources.
“Right now, there is nothing in front of me except in getting the service [back] online.”
Dr Pandey said that the ransomwared infrastructure was effectively preserved for investigation.
“All the evidence, if you want to call it, the scene of crime and so on is there,” he said.
“Nothing has disappeared.
“I took the decision that it is better handed over to the insurer, and they have the team and they are the one who will take care of it from this point onwards.”

If you've stayed at an MGM Resorts hotel, you may be among victims of the latest massive data breach. The personal details of more than 10.6 million hotel guests were recently posted on a hacking forum, and
ZDNet
has confirmed the data's authenticity.
ZDNet
said the data dump contains affected guests' full names, home addresses, phone numbers, emails and dates of birth. Names and information in the breach include tech CEOs, celebrities, government officials and reporters.
In a statement, MGM Resorts said it already notified affected customers about the breach last year, and that it commissioned two cybersecurity forensics firms to investigate the incident. While guests who only stayed at the resort more recently may not have had their information included, it's unclear which years were covered.
Upon being notified about the breach, the MGM Resorts team told the publication that the company was able to trace the leaked data back to a security breach that took place last year. MGM said that last summer, it discovered an unauthorized entry to a cloud server that housed some information for ""certain previous guests"" to its hotels.
The spokesperson emphasized that the company is confident ""no financial, payment card or password data was involved in this matter."" And it seems to be much smaller in scale compared to the Marriott security breach, which
exposed
500 million guests' details, including 5 million
unencrypted passport
numbers. Nevertheless, as breach monitoring service
Under the Breach
told
ZDNet
, the leaked information is enough to make affected guests a target of spearphishing attacks and SIM-swapping schemes. Details from the breach
have been added to the Have I Been Pwned database
, and you can register there for a notification of whether your email address is among those included.

MGM Resorts in Las Vegas alone include, Bellagio, Aria Resort & Casino, Vdara, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Delano Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay Convention Center where major CES events take place, MGM Grand Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena, Skylofts at MGM Grand, The Mansion at MGM Grand, The Signature at MGM Grand, The Mirage, New York-New York, and Park MGM.
The MG Grand alone attracts over 2,000 CES guests during CES now it’s been revealed that the data exposed included names, address, and passport numbers of people who stayed at MGM Resort properties during CES.
The stolen information was posted to a hacking forum this week.
I have stayed at the MGM Grand for the last 25 years during CES and prior to that Comdex and I have received no notification of the hack despite it being discovered several months ago.
Now the resort chain is claiming that they are unable to say exactly how many people were impacted.
MGM said it was “confident” no financial information had been exposed despite them not knowing which data has been extracted.
Normally MGM keeps credit card information on the same database and inside the profile of a guest.
“Last summer, we discovered unauthorized access to a cloud server that contained a limited amount of information for certain previous guests of MGM Resorts. We are confident that no financial, payment card or password data was involved in this matter,” a spokesperson for MGM Resorts said.
Among the people who were impacted included celebrities like Justin Bieber and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.
MGM said most of the data that was stole was “phonebook information” like names, telephone numbers and email addresses, which are already publicly available.
The Hotel Group has admitted that they only told 53,000 guests that their information had been compromised.
MGM said its notification to customers followed state laws. Most US states do not require companies to tell customers if data which is already public has been exposed during a hack.
Passport numbers are not public information.
MGM has resorts in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Detroit in the US. It also has property in China and Japan and is developing a new resort in Dubai.
According to ZDNet the data was posted to a hacking forum. Cyber attackers can use all sorts of information, even data that is less sensitive, to target an individual online.
This is not the largest hacking of hotel guest information. In 2017, Marriott Hotels experienced a much larger data breach exposing 500 million guests. That attack was linked to Chinese state-sponsored hackers.

Slickwraps, a company that makes vinyl skins for popular gadgets, has revealed that its website was compromised, and personal details of its customers exposed.
The company tweeted that an “unauthorized party” had gained access to its database, breaching details including customer names, email ids and addresses, although passwords and credit card information were unaffected.

The hack was uncovered by a security researcher named Lynx, who shared a Medium post stating that he was able to access Slickwraps’s server in January using a vulnerability in the custom skin image upload section of the website.

In his post, Lynx mentioned that he not only got access to admin details, customer billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers, customer photos but also obtained access to internal details including the resumes of employees, ZenDesk ticketing system, API credentials and even social media accounts.
The researcher took to Twitter to inform Slickwraps about the vulnerabilities; however, the company's support team appeared clueless about his claims.
While all his tweets and the medium post are now deleted, Lynx mentioned that since the vulnerability is still not fixed, other hackers might be able to access the data. Rather than acting on his information, Lynx was blocked on Twitter by the Slickwraps social media team.
Following the disclosure, hackers were eventually able to get hold of the data and sent an email to over 377,000 customers using Slickwraps official support ID informing them about the compromise. As of now, there is no report of malicious use of personal details.

Slickwraps issued a statement accepting the breach and apologized to the customers with a promise to enhance their security process. The company also announced that it will partner with a third-party cyber security firm for a security audit and implement their suggestions to improve security protocols.
The official statement from Slickwraps reads “There is nothing we value higher than trust from our users. We are reaching out to you because we've made a mistake in violation of that trust. On February 21st, we discovered information in some of our non-production databases was mistakenly made public via an exploit. During this time, the databases were accessed by an unauthorized party.
The information did not contain passwords or personal financial data. The information did contain names, user emails, addresses.”

We’ve never met six-year-old Kate*. But we know a lot about her.
We know she was born on October 8, 2013, and lives with her family in a small city in north-eastern Switzerland, renowned for its monasteries.
We know exactly where she was at 7.47am on any other ordinary day – down to the street number, name and suburb.
In fact, we can even show you.

But Kate doesn’t know that we know all this – or that we even exist.
She is one of a number of people whose personal information – including real-time locations, phone numbers, dates of birth and contacts – were inadvertently exposed in what has been described as a “concerning” data breach.
‘I could go in there and start messaging them’
From the other side of the globe, Darren McCormack inadvertently found himself entwined in the lives of a group of complete strangers.
The father of four from Perth bought his daughter a TCL MoveTime Family Watch for Christmas.
It functions just like a mobile phone, but with the added ability to view the wearer’s location.
Last month, after his daughter set out for a bike ride with her older sister, he logged into the device’s smartphone app to see where they were.
Kate’s real name, birthday and phone number were also exposed (and have been removed for privacy reasons). Image: Darren McCormack
“There was a little button down the bottom that said connect with Facebook. I clicked it and it came up straight with one of those first screenshots, this random person’s account,” he said.
“I clicked through the settings, I could see their GPS location, their phone numbers, dates of birth. I could go in there and start messaging them.”
In some cases, he was even able to play voice messages that children had left for their parents.
Each time he tried to log into the app, it would connect him with “a random person’s account”, where their personal information was again exposed.
“The concerning part is, I don’t know whether or not my daughter’s information was disclosed to someone else throughout that weekend,” he said.
“You’ve got no way to know.”
‘Anybody could potentially track someone’
According to Damien Manuel, the director of Deakin University’s Cyber Security Research and Innovation Centre (CSRI) and chairman of the Australian Information Security Association (AISA), this kind of breach is “pretty common”.
“The challenge with all of this stuff is it relies on good authentication processes and mechanisms put in by device manufacturers or software manufacturers,” he said.

“Because they’re always trying to compete with each other and get the latest version out really quickly, a lot of testing doesn’t necessarily occur and there’s bugs.”
These bugs – including data leaksandother security flaws –have been well documented in a range of tracking brands since the fruition of this technology in the market, prompting countries such asGermany to ban their sale outright.
Across the pond, US consumer groups have asked the government to investigate if theyrun afoul of laws concerning privacy and consumer protection.
But while there are valid questions as towhether it really matters if a stranger on the other side of the world has access to our personal information, Mr Manuel says consumers should be “very careful”.
“There’s the chance that if [Darren] could do that, that other people could see his daughter as well,” he said.
“Be cautious of the fact that if you can track somebody, anybody else could potentially track someone.”

‘We apologise to any users who were impacted by this issue’
When contacted by the ABC, a spokesperson for TCL Communications, which manufactures the watch, said the issue had since been rectified.
“After checking on this report further, it was found that a software bug was the root cause of this issue,” they said.
“Our teams identified this prior to you contacting us and this was corrected with an update on January 28 – less than 24 hours after it was first detected.
“We apologise to any users who were impacted by this issue, but they should rest assured that we take the data security and privacy of our customers very seriously and make every effort to avoid these issues.”
Mr McCormack, who says he noticed the issue on January 25, has been keeping a “close eye” on the device ever since.
“You’ve got no way to know whether or not my daughter’s personal information was disclosed, her location, date of birth, phone number,” he said.
“I’ve been keeping an eye on the device and haven’t seen any contacts, but it’s obviously very concerning.”

Logistics giant Toll Group has confirmed it has fallen victim to a ransomware cyber attack that has forced it to shut down online systems and manually process parcels since late last week.
Customers of the Japan Post-owned Australian operation have been growing increasingly irate at a lack of information about the lengthy disruption to its operations, which the company said began on Friday.

Toll Group confirms ""targeted"" ransomware attack
By
Ry Crozier
Feb 4 2020 6:08PM
Does not say what attackers were after.
Toll Group has confirmed it is the victim of a “targeted ransomware attack” that led it to “immediately isolate and disable” IT systems to stop the malware from spreading.
The logistics giant
finally posted confirmation
of the attack type and customer-facing impact late on Tuesday, having refused to comment to
iTnews
a day earlier.
Read the latest: Toll Group hit by ""new variant"" of Mailto ransomware
iTnews
reported that
as many as 1000 servers in Toll’s data centre had been infected
, and that staff had been advised not to turn on machines or try to connect them to the corporate network.
The company said today that it
became aware of the issue
on Friday 31 January.
“As soon as it came to light, we moved quickly to disable the relevant systems and initiate a detailed investigation to understand the cause and put in place measures to deal with it,” Toll said.
“We’ve been working around the clock since then to mitigate the impact and ensure customers can continue to access services.”
Toll said its parcel processing centres are operating, “albeit at reduced speed in some cases”. It was still accepting pickups booked via phone.
“We’re continuing to meet the needs of many of our customers through a combination of manual and automated processes across our global operations, although some are experiencing delay or disruption,” it said.
Toll said it is working with “relevant authorities” and “the appropriate bodies for criminal investigation”.
The company said it was specifically targeted by the attackers, but did not say what the attackers were after.
Toll said that “at this stage, [it has] seen no evidence to suggest any personal data has been lost”.
The company also said that while it understood mounting customer complaints about missing and untrackable deliveries, it needed to focus on securing and cleaning its IT environment.
“While it’s an unfortunate situation, particularly for our customers, we’re committed to ensuring the security of our systems before we resume normal online operations,” Toll said.

Toll Group hit by ""new variant"" of Mailto ransomware
By
Ry Crozier
Feb 5 2020 3:02PM
Shares samples with Australian Cyber Security Centre, researchers.
Toll Group says it has been hit with a “new variant” of ransomware known as Mailto or Kokoklock, and that samples have been provided to the Australian Cyber Security Centre and other researchers.
The logistics company has been suffering the effects of the infection
since Friday last week
, when it was forced to shut down much of its IT infrastructure to prevent the malware from spreading.
The ransomware is believed to have
infected as many as 1000 servers
, including Active Directory.
“The ransomware that has affected Toll is a new variant of the Mailto ransomware,” the company said in an
update
Wednesday.
“We have shared samples of the relevant variant with law enforcement, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and cyber security organisations to ensure the wider community is protected.”
Mailto appends random extensions to file names, making them unusable. It first appeared in around September 2019.
Toll indicated that it was starting to recover from the attack, saying that “many of our customers are now able to access our services across large parts of the network globally including freight, parcels, warehousing and logistics, and forwarding operations.”
“Based on a combination of automated and manual processes instituted in place of the affected IT systems, freight volumes are returning to usual levels,” it claimed.
“We have also increased staffing at our contact centres to assist with customer service.”
However it noted there were still delivery delays being felt across its global network.
“Notwithstanding the fact services are being provided largely as normal, some customers are experiencing delays or disruption and we’re working to address these issues as we focus on bringing our regular IT systems back online securely,” Toll said.

Toll Group tight-lipped on alleged ransomware attack
By
Ry Crozier
Feb 4 2020 6:57AM
May have infected over 1000 servers.
Toll Group is staying tight-lipped on what appears to be a large-scale ransomware attack that has infected a sizable part of its IT infrastructure.
The logistics giant first reported
that it was suffering from the effects of a “cyber security incident” on Friday last week.
That continued into this week with pickup and tracking systems, including its MyToll portal, offline.
Read the latest: Toll Group hit by ""new variant"" of Mailto ransomware
A support line for MyToll reached by
iTnews
on Monday afternoon said it was “closed” and to email instead.
The company said in a statement that “as a precautionary measure, in response to a cybersecurity incident on Friday, Toll deliberately shut down a number of systems across multiple sites and business units.”
“Toll IT teams are working closely with global cyber security experts to resolve the issue,” it said.
“Our immediate focus is on bringing our systems back online in a controlled and secure manner.”
A source with knowledge of the incident told
iTnews
that the company has been hit with a sizable ransomware infection that is impacting global operations.
The source said that over 1000 servers had been infected, and that staff worldwide had been told to leave desktops and laptops switched off and disconnected from the corporate network.
The source said Active Directory, productivity and corporate VPN applications were among those infected and taken offline.
This appears to mesh with other reports of the incident sighted by
iTnews
, which claimed ransomware had infected systems in Toll’s main data centre; that the company had no IT systems operating; and that it was in the process of manually cleaning servers in an effort to bring them back online.
iTnews
put its understanding of the incident to Toll Group’s media representatives on Monday.
The company responded with a prepared statement that did not address any of the points.
It did not further respond to follow-up emails and calls made to several media representatives.
Toll Group’s IT operating model includes a sizable workforce outsourced to Infosys.
An Australian spokesperson for Infosys declined to comment on the incident, including whether its teams were involved in the recovery.
“As a matter of corporate policy, Infosys does not comment on client matters,” its spokesperson said.
Toll said it was “making progress” in its recovery efforts.
“Staying focused on customers remains at the forefront of Toll’s priorities as we restore our services and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused,” it said.
“We want to thank our customers for their patience and support.”
Ransomware has been back in the spotlight in the early part of 2020 with high-profile attacks such as on
foreign exchange firm Travelex
, which took the best part of a month to recover from. Travelex has
refused to say publicly
if it paid the $9 million ransom or not.
Total losses from malware can be much more substantial, however. A Petya malware infection
cost fellow logistics firm TNT Express $374 million
, while staff at law firm DLA Piper put in
15,000 hours of overtime
to recover from an encounter with the same piece of malware.

Impacts bookings and tracking systems.
Freight giant Toll Group has shut down ""a number"" of IT systems due to a ""cyber security incident"", with customers reporting shipment tracking is down and drivers are reverting to manual receipts.
Toll said in a brief statement on its website late Friday last week that “as a precautionary measure, Toll has made the decision to shut down a number of systems in response to a suspected cyber security incident.”
“We are investigating the root cause to resolve the issue,” the company said.
“We expect several Toll customer-facing applications to be impacted as a result.
“Our immediate priority is to resume services to impacted customers as soon as possible. We will continue to provide regular updates.”

Customers expecting Toll deliveries
reported
that systems were down at Toll depots.
The MyToll website, which allows pickups to be booked and deliveries tracked, remained down on Monday, displaying the cyber security warning.
One customer indicated that Toll was still making deliveries but receipts were being recorded manually instead of electronically.
Toll is often used for eBay Australia deliveries as well as for new handset and SIM purchases from mobile carriers.
Toll Group is owned by Japan Post.

ACSC gets to grips with Mailto threat after Toll Group infection
By
Ry Crozier
Feb 6 2020 5:30PM
Releases hash of ransomware ""from this incident"".
The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has released a SHA-256 hash of the Mailto ransomware that infected Toll Group, but says there is “limited information” on the initial intrusion vector and how the malware moved once inside the company's network.
The centre issued its
first advisory
on the infection late Thursday, after Toll said yesterday it had asked for the ACSC’s assistance.
ACSC said it was unaware whether the attack on Toll Group was “indicative of a broader campaign” using the Mailto ransomware.
“Currently, the ACSC has limited information about the initial intrusion vector for Mailto infections,” it said.
“There is some evidence that Mailto actors may have used phishing and password spray attacks, and then used compromised accounts to send further phishing emails to the users address book to spread the malware.
“There is currently limited information from this compromise on how the malware is spread laterally across a network.
“The ACSC is continuing to monitor the situation and will update this advisory with any additional details.”
As part of its advisory, ACSC released a SHA-256 hash of the Mailto ransomware “from this incident”.
Hashing
is a method used in threat intelligence to identify malware and to provide a unique identifier that can be used by others to search for the presence of the malware in their own networks.
Toll Group was forced to
shut down many of its IT systems
after discovering the ransomware on January 31.
iTnews
revealed Tuesday
that as many as 1000 servers may have been infected and were being manually cleaned.
Toll Group said Wednesday that it had
been infected by a “new variant”
of the Mailto ransomware.
The logistics giant indicated recovery efforts were still ongoing through Thursday afternoon, as it approached a week since the infection was discovered.
""As we work through our IT recovery plan in response to the recent cyber attack, our focus is on restoring the relevant underlying infrastructure and fully-automated systems, and on conducting a thorough review of the affected IT hardware including servers, systems and devices,"" Toll Group said in a new statement.
""In doing so, we are working closely with our cyber security advisers to ensure that any risk associated with this incident has been appropriately managed and neutralised.""

The personal email addresses of nearly 100 people have been exposed by Yarra Trams in yet another data breach involving Victorian commuters.
In an email from a Yarra Trams officer to 91 commuters rejecting their compensation requests on Friday, the private email addresses of each of the commuters was exposed.
The email was sent about 3pm and was followed up by another message 15 minutes later, in which the company attempted to recall the email but instead sent another note exposing the list of private addresses.
One commuter, who requested to be known only as John, said he was furious that his private details had been exposed against his will.
""I'm very disappointed that Yarra Trams was releasing my personal information,"" John said.
Loading
""Yarra Trams had got a privacy policy which they're obviously not following and that information was shared with a large number of other members of the public.""
Some commuters were entitled to claim a free trip after Yarra Trams failed to deliver enough of its scheduled services in December last year.
Any tram passenger with a myki pass for 28 days or more and who touched on at least 10 times in December was eligible for compensation.
However, 91 of the commuters who applied for compensation were found to be ineligible.

Public Transport Users Association spokesman Daniel Bowen said transport operators must ""take the utmost care with private data such as email addresses"".
""This breach shows they need to review their procedures and staff training to ensure a similar mistake does not happen again.
""It also raises the question of why passengers need to apply for compensation in the first place. Myki data is used to verify the eligibility of those who apply – it should be used to proactively pay compensation to all eligible passengers.""
Yarra Trams has apologised to commuters whose emails were shared.
Credit:
It comes months after Public Transport Victoria and the Department of Premier and Cabinet gave a
hacking and data science conference unfettered access to travel data
stored on about 15 million myki cards used in the three years to June 2018.
The 1.8 billion ""touch-on"" and ""touch-off"" events on the cards included information about a commuter's route and stop number and the specific train they were on.
The Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner released a stinging report on the extraordinary breach last year.
A Yarra Trams spokesman confirmed an employee had exposed the email addresses of those who had their compensation claims rejected.
""Yarra Trams would like to apologise to everyone who received the email regarding unsuccessful compensation claims,"" the spokesman said. ""We will be putting in place more thorough checks and balances to ensure this does not happen again.""
A spokeswoman for the Victorian Information Commissioner said the office had not yet been contacted by Yarra Trams or those affected by the breach.

Health service providers should use this four-step plan to contain and manage a data breach involving personal information, including the My Health Record system. The plan has been developed by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, Australian Digital Health Agency, Australian Cyber Security Centre and Services Australia.
Download the print version
Long text description
A data breach occurs when information held by an organisation is compromised or lost, or is accessed or disclosed without authorisation. For example, unauthorised access to health records, or lost client data.
Step 1: Contain — Take action to contain the breach
Take immediate steps to limit further access to, or distribution of, the affected information and to reduce the possible compromise of other information. Activate your organisation’s data breach response plan, and seek professional assistance if required.
For example, stop the unauthorised practice, recover the records, or disconnect the system that was breached. Additional steps may include setting or changing passwords on client databases, turning on two factor authentication, attempting to recall unread emails, changing computer access privileges, and disconnecting internet connectivity.
Does the data breach relate to the My Health Record system?
No
Step 2: Evaluate — Assess any risks associated with the breach
Consider whether the data breach involves personal information and is likely to result in serious harm to any individuals (such as physical, psychological, emotional, financial or reputational harm). Can remedial action remove the likelihood of serious harm?
If remedial action is successful, a provider should progress to the review stage. If not, this may be an eligible data breach under the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme regulated by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Assessment guidelines can be found on their website (see reverse).
Step 3: Notify — Contact all relevant parties
When an organisation believes an eligible data breach has occurred, they must promptly notify affected individuals.
The organisation must also notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner as soon as practicable using the form that is available on their website (see reverse).
Does the affected data contain Centrelink, Child Support or Medicare (customer and/or provider) information? Contact Services Australia (see reverse).
Continue to Step 4.
Yes
Step 2: Evaluate — Assess any risks associated with the breach
All data breaches related to the My Health Record system must be reported!
This includes situations that have (or may have) resulted in unauthorised collection, use or disclosure of information in a My Health Record and events or circumstances that have (or may have) compromised the security or integrity of the My Health Record system.
Step 3: Notify — Contact all relevant parties
When a data breach relates to the My Health Record system, organisations must notify the Australian Digital Health Agency as soon as practicable (see reverse). In most cases you will also need to ask the Agency to contact affected individuals. Organisations must also notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner* as soon as practicable (see reverse).
* Public hospitals and health services are only required to notify the Australian Digital Health Agency.
Does the affected data containCentrelink, Child Support orMedicare (customer and/or provider) information? ContactServices Australia (see reverse).
Continue to Step 4.
Step 4: Review — Minimise the likelihood and effects of future data breaches
Thoroughly investigate the cause of the breach.
Develop a prevention and response plan and conduct audits to ensure the plan is implemented.
Review and strengthen security practices, consider changing organisational policies and procedures for maintaining data, and revise staff training practices.
Refer to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s Guide to health privacy and other resources to identify additional steps that may be required (see reverse).
Advice from the Australian Cyber Security Centre is also available to assist organisations with developing a cyber incident response plan (see reverse).

THE TOLL HACK IS A WARNING TO EVERY AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS
By Rachael Falk, CEO Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre
Published in the AFR 18/02/2020
The recentcyber attack on Toll Holdingshas been described as ""crippling"" and the ""most significant in Australian corporate history"".
The lesson for anyone who operates a business reliant on connectivity is that cyber resilience must be treated like the key business risk it is.
All executives and boards should ask: How can my business recover if it loses access to valuable systems and data, or if the integrity of its systems and data is compromised?
This used to be called business continuity management, but that term sounds almost quaint in today's connected world.
In 2020, data breaches and cyber attacks are entirely foreseeable events. Recent history is replete with examples of stolen data or systems taken offline. The cyber attack on Toll may have been spectacular, but it is not the first and certainly won’t be the last.
For systems to run safely and efficiently, information security management must respect the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability: known to the cyber security sector by the acronym CIA.
Until now most focus has been on confidentiality, or keeping valuable data safe. This made sense given the amount of sensitive and valuable data generated, stored, sliced and transported. Yet even this emphasis on safeguarding confidentiality has not prevented high-profile data breaches on seemingly a weekly basis.
Perhaps the most damning example was the 2017Equifax data breach, which compromised the personal information of nearly 150 million Americans, in circumstances described as “entirely preventable” in a US congressional report.
While we know that breaches mainly tend to involve data theft, in recent times we have witnessed even more disruptive instances where not only has data been stolen but entire systems have been frozen, with a crippling effect on the profitability and reputation of firms.
The targeting of Toll has been preceded by a variety of other cases, such as the hospital whose scanning machines would not operate, or the global law firm that went offline for three weeks while dealing with the impact of ransomware.
As our society and economy become increasingly interconnected, the consequences of cyber breaches become ever more critical. That means more emphasis must be placed on the integrity and availability of systems.
In the context of online systems, the test of integrity is whether you can trust the data in a system to be accurate and also, crucially, uncorrupted. Increasingly, cyber adversaries not only wish to gain access to systems but also to corrupt it in ways that undermine trust or commercial value. What would happen if, for instance, data about blood types or water samples was hacked and corrupted? The resulting chaos is barely imaginable.
As with integrity, the availability of data is key – as Toll has discovered the hard way. Once its systems were put out of reach, in this case because of ransomware and the unavailability of backups, its data was completely unavailable and the company could barely transact business.
While many organisations still struggle to get the cyber security basics right, the simplest question to answer is whether, in the event that key systems are unavailable, data can still be made available to the extent required to carry on business. This is the fundamental test of business resilience – one that Toll failed, to its considerable detriment.
Of course resilience is about much more than just having backups. It is also about investing in basic cyber security hygiene, understanding the entire spread of your organisation’s IT systems and assets, testing your suppliers’ systems and security postures, and ensuring your people are educated about cyber threats and supported by skilled incident response professionals who can be on hand immediately.
Only when all of these challenges are addressed can a business have confidence that it is beginning to prepare for the reality of operating in a connected world.
The experience of Toll suggests that perhaps, in addition to confidentiality, availability and integrity, all well-run businesses should be adding a fourth principle of cyber preparedness: resilience.",,https://cybersecuritycrc.org.au/toll-hack-warning-every-australian-business/,"{""event_type"": ""CyberEventType.OTHER"", ""severity"": ""EventSeverity.MEDIUM"", ""confidence"": 0.5, ""australian_relevance"": true, ""data_sources_count"": 1, ""publication_date"": null}",2025-09-28T12:18:11.947664,0,,,28/09/2025 2:18,1

The Act provides that where an eligible data breach ... Law, Technology Law and Intellectual ...","The Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme applies to entities (APP Entities) that are required to protect personal information pursuant to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Act). The Act provides that where an eligible data breach (EDB) occurs, APP Entities in control of that information must notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the individuals who are affected by the EDB.
An EDB arises where there has been unauthorised access, loss or disclosure of personal information by an APP Entity (Unauthorised Disclosure) and such disclosure is likely to cause serious harm[1] to the individuals whose personal information is stored.
An EDB may also occur where data breach was likely to occur and if Data Breach were to occur, it would be likely to result in serious harm.
Where a data breach occurs and the APP is able to take remedial action, it may prevent an EDB from occurring. An example of remedial action steps may include where an employee of an APP Entity leaves her laptop containing employee records in a taxi. The employee then immediately phones tech support, who disables that computer’s access to the network and the records.
Assessing serious harm, requires careful consideration of some key concepts which is the purpose of this article.
What exactly is ‘serious harm’?
Serious harm is not defined in the Act. Therefore, whether an individual is likely to suffer serious harm is an objective test from the perspective of a reasonable person. The OAIC describes a ‘reasonable person’ as:
“a person in the entity’s position (rather than the position of an individual whose personal information was part of the data breach or any other person), who is properly informed, based on information immediately available or following reasonable inquiries or an assessment of the data breach.”[2]
‘Reasonable person’ is also discussed in general terms in Chapter B of the OAIC’s APP Guidelines.
The OAIC has issued a guidelines on factors to consider when assessing whether serious harm is likely in the event of a Data Breach.[3] In the context of a Data breach, serious harm to an individual may include serious physical, psychological, emotional, financial, or reputational harm. The Privacy Act provides a non-exhaustive list of ‘relevant matters’ that may assist entities to assess the likelihood of serious harm. These are set out in s 26WG of the Act, and are summarised below.
Types of personal information involved in the data breach
There are various types of personal information that may increase the risk of serious harm if Unauthorised Disclosure occurs:
‘sensitive information’, such as information about an individual’s health;
documents commonly used for identity fraud (including Medicare card, driver licence, and passport details);
financial information; and
a combination of types of personal information (rather than a single piece of personal information) that allows more to be known about the individuals the information is about.[4]
The circumstances of the data breach
The specific circumstances of the data breach are relevant when assessing whether there is a risk of serious harm to an individual. This may include a consideration of the following:
whose personal information was involved in the breach;
how many individuals were involved;
how long the information has been accessible; and
who may have gained unauthorised access to the personal information.[5]
The nature of the harm that may result from the data breach
In assessing whether there has been serious harm, organisations should consider the broad range of potential harms that may follow a data breach. Examples may include:
identity theft;
significant financial loss by the individual;
threats to an individual’s physical safety;
loss of business or employment opportunities;
humiliation, damage to reputation or relationships; and
workplace or social bullying or marginalisation.
The likelihood of a serious harm occurring, as well as the anticipated consequences for individuals whose personal information is involved in the data breach if the harm materialises, are relevant considerations.[6]
Further, it is worth noting that whilst individuals may be distressed or upset at an Unauthorised Disclosure, such a reaction alone is insufficient in and of itself to constitute a EDB.
OAIC observations on serious harm
In its Notifiable Data Breaches Statistics Report the OAIC identified contact information as the most common type of personal information disclosed in data breaches between April and June 2019. The OAIC notes that loss of contact information may not result in immediate or financial harm in the same way that losing credit card information would, for example.
With the above considerations in mind, organisations may recognise that further harm can arise from activities such as phishing and social engineering, tactics which are aided by the use of contact information compromised in a data breach. This highlights how, while serious harm may not immediately result from a particular data breach, the flow on effects of these should be considered in determining any serious harm in future.
Takeaways
Serious harm is not easily defined, and therefore requires consideration of various factors including the types of information involved in the Data Breach, the circumstances surrounding the Data Breach and the nature of the harm that may result from the Data Breach. It is important to note that minor data breaches, while on their face may not seem serious, could have a flow on effect and result in serious harm.
Additionally, it is important for APP Entities to have a data breach response plan in place as part of their risk and compliance measures in the context of internet law. Organisation that are capable of taking swift, remedial action on Unauthorised Access may prevent expensive assessment and notification processes to be undertaken. Preparation for remedial action may also prevent your company finding itself in the embarrassing, and potentially very public, position of notifying its clients that their data has been compromised.

28 February 2020
Malicious or criminal attacks including cyber incidents remain the leading cause of data breaches involving personal information in Australia, with almost one in three breaches linked to compromised login credentials, a new report shows.
This includes phishing attacks which caused at least 15 per cent of data breaches notified to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) from July to December 2019.
The OAIC’s latest Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Report warns organisations about the risks associated with storing sensitive personal information in email accounts.
Australian Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk also highlighted the risk of harm to individuals whose personal information is emailed to the wrong recipient (9% of all breaches).
“The accidental emailing of personal information to the wrong recipient is the most common cause of human error data breaches,” Commissioner Falk said.
“Email accounts are also being used to store sensitive personal information, where it may be accessed by malicious third parties who breach these accounts.
“Organisations should consider additional security controls when emailing sensitive personal information, such as password-protected or encrypted files.
“This personal information should then be stored in a secure document management system and the emails deleted from both the inbox and sent box.”
Personal information stored in email accounts can include financial information, tax file numbers, identity documents and health information, which can be exploited by malicious actors who gain access to inboxes.
In other key findings of the report:
537 data breaches were notified to the OAIC during the reporting period, a 19 per cent increase on the previous six months
Malicious or criminal attacks (including cyber incidents) accounted for 64% of all data breaches
Human error remained a key factor in data breaches, causing 32% of NDBs
Health service providers remained the leading source of NDBs over the six-month period, notifying 22% of all breaches. The OAIC has jointly developed an action plan to help the health sector contain and manage data breaches and implement continued improvement
Finance is the second highest reporting sector, notifying 14% of all breaches
Most data breaches affected less than 100 individuals, in line with previous reporting periods.
Commissioner Falk said the NDB scheme is now well established as an effective reporting mechanism.
“There is now increasing focus on organisations taking preventative action to combat data breaches at their source and deliver best practice response strategies,” Commissioner Falk said.
“Where data breaches occur, organisations and agencies must move swiftly to contain the breach and minimise the risk of harm to people whose information has been compromised.”

The death of former Love Island host Caroline Flack features on most of the front pages, including the Sunday Mail. The 40-year-old, who was found at her home in London, had taken her own life, a lawyer for the family said.
The Sunday Express front page calls Ms Flack's death a ""tragedy"". She stood down from the dating show after she was charged with assaulting her partner in December, a claim she denied. She was due to stand trial next month.
The Sun on Sunday reports that her death came the day after a ""new court shock"". The star's management company have criticised prosecutors in England for pursuing her ""show trial"", even after her partner said he did not support it. In response, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would not comment on ""the specifics of this case"" because of the ""tragic circumstances"".
The Scottish Mail on Sunday reports that the safety of world leaders has been ""put at risk"" by a ""government blunder"" after ""secret plans"" of the venue for a UN summit which is to take place in Glasgow were ""mistakenly"" published online.
The Herald claims that the Scottish Tories will be split over whether Scots should have another say on independence. The paper says that ""growing numbers"" of senior party members support calls for indyref2 - against the wishes of the party's leader, Jackson Carlaw.
The National covers comments made by UK Labour leadership hopeful Rebecca Long Bailey. On Saturday she said refusing another referendum on Scottish independence would ""drive more [Labour] voters into the arms of the SNP"" during an event in Glasgow.
The Sunday Post carries the news that the youngest Scot diagnosed with MND has had a baby boy. Lucy Linott, 25, delivered LJ at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital on Thursday.
Scotland on Sunday carries a story about plans for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.

We strongly recommend organisations review the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC)publication Preparing for and Responding to Denial-of-Service Attacks.
If your organisation is affected by a DoS attack, the ASD’s ACSC recommends:
Talking to your service provider(s) about their ability to immediately implement any responsive actions.
Blocking the offending IP address(es).
Temporarily transferring online services to cloud-based hosting with high bandwidth and content delivery networks that cache non-dynamic websites.
Preferably using multiple major cloud service providers to obtain redundancy.
Engage a DoS attack mitigation service for the duration of the incident.

Some websites, such as that of TV channel Pirveli, were replaced with an image of former President Mikheil Saakashvili in the hack
A huge cyber-attack which knocked out more than 2,000 websites in the country of Georgia last year was carried out by Russia, according to Georgia, the UK and the US.
The UK government says that the GRU (Russian military intelligence) was behind the ""attempt to undermine Georgia's sovereignty"".
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described it as ""totally unacceptable"".
Russia's Foreign Ministry denied any involvement, the RIA news agency said.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) found that the GRU was ""almost certainly"" behind the attacks, which affected pages including Georgia's presidential website and the country's national TV broadcaster. It said the attack was the first significant example of GRU cyber-attacks since 2017.
Previous GRU cyber-attacks
December 2015: An attack on part of Ukraine's electricity grid left 230,000 people without power for between one and six hours
December 2016: A malware designed specifically to disrupt electricity grids led to a fifth of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv losing power for an hour
June 2017: A destructive cyber-attack targeted the Ukrainian financial, energy and government sectors. It also affected other European and Russian businesses
October 2017: The Kyiv metro and Odessa airport, as well as Russia's central bank and two Russian media outlets, were disrupted after ransomware encrypted hard drives
Source: UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office
The UK said Russia had sought to ""sow discord and disrupt the lives of ordinary Georgian people"".
""The Russian Government has a clear choice: continue this aggressive pattern of behaviour against other countries, or become a responsible partner which respects international law,"" Mr Raab said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also condemned the attacks, saying: ""The United States calls on Russia to cease this behaviour in Georgia and elsewhere.""
In many cases, website homepages were replaced with an image of former President Mikheil Saakashvili, and the caption ""I'll be back"".
This is the latest element of an ongoing campaign of pressure by the UK against Russian intelligence since the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury two years ago. The aim is to try and deter Russian activity by exposing it.
A notable aspect of this attribution is that it relates to events which took place relatively recently, in October 2019. One of the targets was Georgian broadcasters.
The GRU's targeting of broadcasters goes back at least to 2015 and a takedown of the French TV5Monde channel. That led to concern about what they might do against other broadcasters in other countries.
This is seen as part of Russia's tactics of hybrid warfare, or grey-zone activities, which are designed to destabilise countries.
The problem for the UK, though, is that so far there is little sign of the GRU being deterred.
A key test will come with the US election this year, and whether it attempts to interfere in that as it was accused of doing in 2016.
""The scale of this attack is something we haven't seen before,"" Prof Alan Woodward, cyber-security expert at Surrey University in the UK, said at the time of the Georgia attack.
During the brief 2008 Russian-Georgian conflict, Georgia accused Moscow of carrying out cyber-attacks against its government, although Russia denied this.

Georgians mourn Russian land grab
The war broke out after Georgia attempted to recapture South Ossetia, which had fought a separatist war against Georgia in the 1990s. Russian forces then entered the country and seized control of the Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Who is Mikheil Saakashvili?
Mr Saakashvili served two terms as president in Georgia between 2004 and 2013.
He gave up his Georgian citizenship in 2015, when he became governor of Ukraine's Odessa region.
He was deported from Ukraine in 2018 after falling out with his predecessor - but his Ukrainian citizenship was restored in May 2019.
Mr Saakashvili is wanted in Georgia on criminal charges, which he claims are politically motivated.

Published by tpc on June 25, 2020 June 25, 2020. The recent news regarding the cyber-attacks being ...","The recent news regarding the cyber-attacks being experienced by the Australian government highlights the importance of security against external attacks. This attack was a concerted and sustained attack on government infrastructure from outside of Australia. Most internet routers have a very basic firewall in them that provides really basic protection against hacking attempts, but these are no match for the sophisticated attacks being made on Australian businesses in current times. Often, a few different security strategies need to be applied and work together to give businesses a more robust security “firewall”. The Australian Cyber Security Centre have identified 8 areas that NEED stronger protection:
Application Control (making sure only the apps you want are installed, and controlling what they do)
Patching security ‘holes’ in Software Apps
“Hardening” the security barrier for software apps
Blocking Macros in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Outlook – a common source of many security issues)
Restrict Admin Privileges – only give administrative access where absolutely needed
Patching Operating Systems such as Windows 10, and Windows Server software
Applying Multi Factor Authentication – making impersonation and identity theft harder
Ensuring your backup strategy is effective. This is critical!
Having a good firewall is vital in today’s times, and coupled with a solid workstation protection software, it just makes your network so much harder to hack. This means that hackers go looking for easier targets elsewhere. All Computer Services uses and recommends Watchguard T-Series firewalls – suitable and priced for small-medium businesses but tough enough to keep the hackers out. Combined with good endpoint “workstation\laptop” protection from security software such as Panda Security, means your network is safe from unscrupulous hackers. This combination recently won the Gartner Award for internal and external protection, while still being affordable.
Having the above is really good, but to make it most effective, understanding how these hackers work and how to recognise hacking attempts, makes your network even more secure. Have you heard of PHISHING attacks? All Computer Services can provide affordable user awareness training to educate staff how to recognise phishing, and other common hacking methods.

The Australian government is grappling with massive cyber attacks in recent months.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described them as a “malicious” and “sophisticated”. Morrison revealed the existence of the attacks during a press conference on Friday. He said a “state-based cyber actor” is “targeting Australian organizations across a range of sectors. This includes all levels of government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure.”
He did not specify which agencies or businesses are believed to be under attack, nor did he detail the exact nature of the attacks. Morrison did say that the government’s investigation has not uncovered any “large-scale personal data breaches.” Morrison also did not say which state Australia believes to be behind the attack. But he told reporters that “there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity.”
“It is clear … that this has been done by a state-based actor with very, very significant capabilities,” Morrison added.
The attacks are also not new, and Morrison made clear that such threats are a “constant issue for Australia to deal with.” But he added that he was prompted to speak Friday because the “frequency has been increasing” over “many months.”

State-based cyber attack targeting Australian government and businesses
Fri, 19th Jun 2020
FYI, this story is more than a year old
By Nick Forrester, Senior News Editor
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealeda malicious and widespread cyber attackis currently underway on businesses and governments in the country.
Morrison told media in a press conference on Friday morning that Australian organisations are being targeted by a 'sophisticated state-based cyber actor'.
""This activity is targeting Australian organisations in a range of sectors, including all levels of government,"" says Morrison.
Political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and other 'critical infrastructure' were also being targeted by the attack.
Morrison added that the scale and nature of the targeting confirmed its status as a sophisticated state-based cyber actor, as well as the tradecraft used in the attack, which is ongoing.
A report from the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) states, ""The Australian Government is currently aware of, and responding to, a sustained targeting of Australian governments and companies by a sophisticated state-based actor.""
The ACSC suggests that the attacks are 'copy-paste compromises', which are attacks leveraging proof-of-concept exploit code, web shells, and other tools that are almost identical to open source tools - hence the term 'copy-paste'.
The exploits relate to Telerik UI, Microsoft Internet Information Services, SharePoint, and Citrix. All exploits were publicly disclosed and have patches or fixes available.
The ACSC states, ""The actor has shown the capability to quickly leverage public exploit proof-of-concepts to target networks of interest and regularly conducts reconnaissance of target networks looking for vulnerable services, potentially maintaining a list of public-facing services to quickly target following future vulnerability releases. The actor has also shown an aptitude for identifying development, test and orphaned services that are not well known or maintained by victim organisations.""
As speculation about who is behind the attacks inevitably comes up, Morrison says the Government is not making any public attribution statements, however, it may be the work of a state-based threat actor.
The attacker has not succeeded in exploiting public-facing infrastructure, however, they have conducted various spearphishing attacks through email tracking, malicious email links, and other links.
The ACSC continues, ""During its investigations, the ACSC identified no intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments.""
Organisations should ensure that patches and mitigations are applied to all internet-facing infrastructure within 48 hours. Organisations should also update operating systems and software, and use multi-factor authentication across email applications, collaboration platforms, virtual private networks (VPNs), and remote desktop services.
""We know what is going on. We are on it, but it is a day-to-day task,"" concludes Morrison.

Australian Cyber Security Hotline 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371). Site ...","Malware is the term used to refer to any type of code or program that is used for a malicious purpose.
Cybercriminals use malware for many different reasons. Common types of malware are used for:
stealing your information and account details
encrypting your data for ransom
installing other software without your knowledge.
A malware attack can have serious and ongoing impacts. Malware can also act as an entry point for cybercriminals, opening the door to further malicious activity.
Malware is distributed in several ways:
by spam email or messages (either as a link or an attachment)
by malicious websites that attempt to install malware when you visit
by exploiting weaknesses in software on your devices
by posing as a trusted application that you download and install yourself.
Some malware may even pretend to be antivirus or security products.
Potential warning signs of malware
Malware can behave in many different ways. There are a number of signs you may notice that could be due to a malware infection.
You notice unusual account activity such as configuration changes, unusual or concurrent logins, and downloading or exporting a large volume of data.
Your passwords have been changed and you are unable to access your accounts.
Your network has unexpected performance issues such as slow speeds or outages.
You notice unusual script execution, software installation and use of admin tools.
There are files and programs you can’t access or don’t recognise.
You get unexpected device performance issues such as slow programs, system error messages, software crashes, battery issues and overheating.
Your web browser automatically takes you to a web page you didn’t intend to open.
Suspicious pop-up ads about updating or downloading software.
Someone knows something they could only have found out if they had access to your device.
Learn more about malware
There are many different types of malware but most are used to either steal your information, your computer’s resources or your money. This table lists some of the most common types of malware affecting people and businesses in the wild today.
Type What it does
Adware Adware is a type of malware that gathers information to show you targeted advertising. In most cases, it is not dangerous but occasionally it can interfere with your system. For instance, it could open a webpage in your browser, which contains another type of malware.
Info stealers Information stealer malware, also known as info stealers, is designed to secretly collect information from a victim’s device, such as user login credentials and system information. Cyber threat actors exploit this information predominantly for monetary gain. For more information, read our information stealer malware advice.
Keyloggers Records which keys you press and sends that information to a cybercriminal. This could include passwords and credit card details.
Pharming A way of harvesting personal information, where a cybercriminal puts malicious code on your device that redirects you to a fake website.
Ransomware A type of malware that encrypts all your personal files and prevent access to them, unless a ransom is paid to restore access to the files. For guidance on preventing ransomware, read our ransomware advice.
Trojans and backdoors Traditionally, trojans are programs that appear to serve a useful purpose but do something malicious when run. Trojans may steal information, download additional malicious files or even provide a ‘backdoor’ into your device – allowing a cybercriminal to do almost anything they like.
Viruses and Worms Viruses infect files by inserting themselves into the file’s code and then running whenever the file is opened. Worms are standalone malicious programs that spread themselves from computer to computer. Similar to Trojans, viruses and worms can have many different payloads – for example, they can steal your information, download and install other malicious files, delete your files or even send spam.
Web Shell Malware Malicious scripts that allow cyber criminals to compromise web servers and use it as a permanent backdoor to launch additional attacks. ASD and NSAhave jointly produced a Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Detect and Prevent Web Shell Malware (PDF)
More information
How to protect yourself from malware
Malware (short for 'malicious software') is software that cybercriminals use to harm your computer system or network. Cybercriminals can use malware to gain access to your computer without you knowing, in targeted or broad-based attacks.
