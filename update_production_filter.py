FIRST, determine if this is actually a cybersecurity INCIDENT and if it's Australian-relevant.

Event Title: {request.title}

Affected Entities: {', '.join(request.entity_names)}
Raw Data Snippets: {' '.join(request.raw_data_sources)}

STEP 1 - VALIDATION (CRITICAL):
- `is_cybersecurity_event`: Is this genuinely about ONE SPECIFIC cybersecurity INCIDENT that actually happened to a named organization?
  - Return TRUE ONLY for: actual data breaches, cyber attacks, malware infections, ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns that OCCURRED to ONE specific named company/organization
  - Return FALSE for:
    * AUTOMATICALLY REJECT any document with title containing: "Multiple", "Several", "Various", "incidents", "January 2020", "Q1 2020", etc.
    * ANY document about creating, developing, or implementing policies/plans/frameworks
    * ANY document describing multiple incidents or breaches in a time period
    * ANY general market summaries, industry reports, or trend analyses
    * ANY document about incidents in a time period (e.g., "January 2020", "Q1 2020", "2020 breaches")
    * ANY document reporting statistics like "X reports", "X incidents", "X cybercrime reports"
    * Regulatory guidance, compliance documents, privacy principles, legal frameworks
    * Risk assessments, security recommendations, policy documents, action plans
    * General statistics, trend reports, sector overviews
    * Training materials, educational content, best practices
    * "OAIC Notifiable Data Breaches" reports - these are regulatory summaries, not specific incidents
    * "Australian Government Entities Targeted" - these are general reports, not specific incidents

- `is_australian_relevant`: Does this SPECIFIC INCIDENT affect Australian organizations, systems, or citizens?
  - Return FALSE for: generic global events, events in other countries without Australian impact

STEP 2 - ENHANCED REJECTION RULES:
AUTOMATICALLY REJECT if title contains any of these patterns:
- "Multiple [anything] Incidents"
- "Various [anything] Breaches"
- "Several [anything] Attacks"
- "[Month] [Year]" patterns (e.g., "January 2020", "Q1 2020")
- "OAIC [anything] Report"
- "Notifiable Data Breaches Report"
- "Action Plan", "Framework", "Guidelines", "Recommendations"
- "Increase in [anything] Attacks" (trend reporting)
- "Entities Targeted" (general targeting reports)

ONLY ACCEPT if:
- Title names a SPECIFIC organization (e.g., "Toll Group", "Perth Mint", "Medibank")
- Describes a SPECIFIC incident that happened to that organization
- Has clear Australian connection to the specific incident

Be extremely conservative. When in doubt, reject the event.
