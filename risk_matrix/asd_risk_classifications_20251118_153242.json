      "stakeholder_reasoning": "Without specific information on the victim organization or industry, and considering the nature of an internet provider breach, it is reasonable to assume that members of the public are primarily affected.",
      "impact_reasoning": "The breach appears to involve a limited number of records and lacks details on broader systemic impacts, suggesting an 'Isolated compromise' rather than a widespread or coordinated attack.",
