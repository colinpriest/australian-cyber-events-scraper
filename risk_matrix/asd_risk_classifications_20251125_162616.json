      "severity_reasoning": "The event affected 80,000 records, which falls into the 10,000-100,000 range, suggesting a C3-C4 severity. Given the involvement of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), a federal entity, and the high severity of the event, C3 is appropriate.",
      "stakeholder_reasoning": "The primary stakeholder affected is the Federal government, as the ATO is a federal entity. The impact on ATO services directly affects government operations and public trust.",
      "impact_reasoning": "The locking out of tens of thousands of accounts indicates an extensive compromise, as it significantly disrupts access to important government services for a large number of individuals.",

      "severity_reasoning": "The severity category C3 is chosen because the ransomware attack affected 31,500 records, which falls into the range of 10,000-100,000 records. This aligns with the criteria for C3, which involves substantial impact on organizations and moderate data breaches.",
      "stakeholder_reasoning": "The primary stakeholder category is 'Regulated critical infrastructure' because the attack targeted a public health service, which is considered part of critical infrastructure due to its essential role in public health and safety.",
      "impact_reasoning": "The impact type is classified as 'Extensive compromise' because the ransomware attack resulted in a significant number of records being affected, indicating a widespread impact on the data integrity and availability of the health service.",
      "information_quality": "The information quality is moderate, as the number of records affected is known, but there is limited information on the specific attack method or the full extent of service disruption. The lack of detailed description and summary limits the assessment's depth."
